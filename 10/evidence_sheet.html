<h4>ES1. David Kennedy, Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929 – 1945 (Oxford, 1999)</h4>
<p>Some things about FDR were well and widely understood: that he shared his cousin Theodore's belief in the supremacy of the public interest over private interests and in the government's role as the active agent of the public interest; that he meant to preside over a government even more vigorously interventionist and directive than Hoover's; that he intended to use government power to redress what he judged to be harmful and unfair imbalances in the American economy,especially the huge income gap between the agricultural and industrial sectors; that he had long been seeking for ordinary Americans some measure of the economic security and predictability of life's material circumstances that his own patrician class took for granted; that he had a lover's passion for the cause of conservation; that he was a champion of public waterpower...</p>
<h4>ES2. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speech at Oglethorpe University, May 22, 1934</h4>
<p>&quot;The country needs, and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, Fireside Chat, September 30, 1934</h4>
<p>&quot;In our efforts for recovery we have avoided, on the one hand, the theory that business should and must be taken over into an all-embracing Government. We have avoided, on the other hand, the equally untenable theory that it is an interference with liberty to offer reasonable help when private enterprise is in need of help. The course we have followed fits the American practice of Government—a practice of taking action step by step, of regulating only to meet concrete needs...&quot;</p>
<h4>ES4. Jonathan Alder, The Defining Moment: FDR's One Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope (Simon and Schuster, 2007)</h4>
<p>&quot;... but something inside the man kept him from moving in an extra-constitutional direction. Some combination of personal and democratic conviction set him on a different course, at once more traditional and bold. This most pragmatic of modern American presidents sensed the unworkable nature of untrammeled power, even in the hands of the only person he completely trusted—himself.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES5. Franklin D. Roosevelt, January, 1935, quoted in William E. Leuchtneburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932 – 1940 (Harper and Row, 1963)</h4>
<p>The dole is &quot;a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit. . . . I am not willing that the vitality of our people be further sapped by the giving of cash, of market baskets, of a few hours of weekly work cutting grass, raking leaves or picking up papers in the public parks. The Federal Government must and shall quit this business of relief.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES6. FDR on the proper role of government, Annual Message to Congress, 1938</h4>
<p>&quot;Government has a final responsibility for the well-being of its citizenship. If private cooperative endeavor [same thing as Voluntarism] fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate, those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the Government for aid; and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES7. Tindall, previous edition</h4>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt and the New Dealers went beyond the concept of regulated capitalism by insisting that the government not simply respond to social crises but also take positive steps to avoid them. To this end, the New Deal's various benefit programs sought to ensure a minimal level of well-being for all Americans. The New Deal had established minimum qualitative standards for labor conditions and public welfare and helped middle-class American hold on to their savings, their homes, and their farms. The protection afforded by bank-deposit insurance, unemployment pay, and Social Security pensions would come to be universally accepted as a safeguard against future depressions.</p>
<h4>ES8. Franklin D. Roosevelt, speech accepting the nomination for the governorship of New York, October 16, 1928</h4>
<p>&quot;In the final analysis, the progress of our civilization will be retarded if any large body of citizens falls behind.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES9. Franklin D. Roosevelt, State of the Union Message to Congress, January 11, 1944</h4>
<p>&quot;In this war, we have been compelled to learn how interdependent upon each other are all groups and sections of the population of America...<br />
It is our duty now to begin to lay the plans and determine the strategy for the winning of a last peace and the establishment of an American standard of living higher than ever before known. We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people—whether it be one-third, one-fifth or one-tenth—is ill-fed, ill-clothed, illhoused, and insecure.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES10: C. Economic Recovery (on your lecture outline)</h4>
<p><strong>How?</strong> Use the national government to stabilize the economy.<br />
Recall FDR's pattern of problem solving.<br />
<strong>For Agriculture: AAA</strong> (p. 926)<br />
<strong>For Industry: NRA</strong> (p.925-926)<br />
What did each agency attempt to do?<br />
Did these agencies achieve any success?<br />
How would Hoover have viewed the AAA and the NRA?</p>
