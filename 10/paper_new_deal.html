<p>1. Describe and explain Roosevelt's beliefs about the proper role of government. Be sure to include information from ES #6-9.</p>
<p>2. Examine two of Roosevelt's New Deal programs that responded to the economic crisis. Explain how each is linked to FDR's beliefs about the proper role of government.

Be sure to include information from the Social Security sheet.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's beliefs</h3>
<p>Roosevelt shared his cousin Theodore's belief in the supremacy of the public interest over private interest and in the government's role as the active agent of the public interests. He believed government has a final responsibility for the well-being of its citizenship. If private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for the willing hands and relief for the unfortunate, a government must make fitting response. FDR's vision of Good society is to move the national government to the forefront, assign a new and expansive role to the national government and shape and improve the society. FDR and the New deal went beyond the concept of regulated capitalism by insisting that the government not simply respond to social crise but also take positive steps to avoid them and their social effect.<br />
Roosevelt also feared the danger of dole. &quot;... I am not willing that the vitality of our people be further sapped by the giving of cashâ€¦ The federal government must and shall quit this business of relief.&quot;</p>
<h3>New Deal programs</h3>
<p>The most successful of the New Deal jobs programs was the CCC. It built 2500 camps to house up to half a million unemployed, unmarried young men ages between 17-27. They worked as &quot;soil soldiers&quot; in national forests, parks, and recreational areas, and on soil -conservation projects. Through CCC, two underutilized resources were joined, young men and public land. The public viewed the programs as a wholesome programs and it helped instill moral values to young men. However, Hoover criticized that the CCC would introduce dependence on government. (entitlement mentality) and it was not government's responsibility to put young men to work. (private sectors create jobs.)</p>
<p>In the Second New Deal, FDR proposed the Social Security Act of 1935.  Social Security, he announced, the &quot;cornerstone&quot; and &quot;supreme achievement&quot; of the New Deal. Social Security is a national government social insurance program with two parts, a national government system of old age insurance, and a national government partnership with the states on unemployment insurance, aid to dependent mothers and children and aid to the handicapped. The Social Security Act of 1935 is the cornerstone of the Public Service Concept of the State (also known as the Welfare State)--which was defined as the belief that government should be active and seek to solve social and economic problems. The Social Security Act conferred on citizens a new right: the right to a minimum standard of welfare and required of the national government a new responsibility: to provide a minimum standard of welfare for its citizens.<br />
Republican objected the Social Security on the grounds that it restrict personal liberty, it was no a proper responsibility for government and the government had too much power on the matter and became tyrannical. Hoover</p>
