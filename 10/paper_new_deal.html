<strong>Support your essay by incorporating specific information and examples from the sources available to you:  your class notes, the text, the evidence sheet, the Social Security sheet, the proper role of government sheet, and the article Why Candidates Still Use FDR as Their Measure.</strong></p>
<p>1. Describe and explain Roosevelt's beliefs about the proper role of government.  Be sure to include information from ES #6-9.</p>
<p>2. Examine two of Roosevelt's New Deal programs that responded to the economic crisis. Explain how each is linked to FDR's beliefs about the proper role of government.  Explain why Hoover would have objected to these two responses by FDR.  (Social Security must be one of the two responses you examine.  You're free to choose the other one.)  Be sure to include information from the Social Security sheet.</p>

Social Security was, he annouced, the &quot;cornerstone&quot; and &quot;supreme achievement&quot; of the New Deal.</p>
