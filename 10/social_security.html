<p><strong>Prior to the Social Security Act of 1935, where did the elderly poor and other vulnerable citizens turn for assistance?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In 1929, the national government spent no money on relief except for Indian wards, seamen, and veterans.</li>
<li>In 1929, only eleven states had functioning pension systems. These eleven states paid $222,000 in pensions to about 1,000 old people in 1929. That’s about $220 per recipient per year.</li>
<li>In 1930, only about 15% of workers in private industry were covered by pensions from their employers.</li>
<li>In 1930, no state government provided unemployment insurance.</li>
<li>In 1931, only 93,260 of the 3.8 million female-headed families (that’s one out of forty) received mothers’ assistance from state governments. The average monthly family grant ranged from $4.33 in Arkansas ($56 in today’s $) to $69.31 in Massachusetts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Social Security</strong> is a national government social insurance program with two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A national government system of old age insurance</li>
<li>A national government partnership with the states on:
<ul>
<li>unemployment insurance</li>
<li>aid to dependent mothers and children</li>
<li>aid to the handicapped</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>New direct relationship:</strong><br />
National Govt. ------------------------------------- Vulnerable citizens in need<br />
<strong>The Social Security Act of 1935</strong> is the cornerstone of the Public Service Concept of the State (also known as the Welfare State)--which we have defined as the belief that government should be active and seek to solve social and economic problems. Be sure to memorize this definition of the public service concept of the state.</p>
<p><strong>Who would be responsible for the welfare of citizens unable to support themselves?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prior to the Social Security Act:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The individual was responsible first. Then look for charity in family, community, churches, or other civil society institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After the Social Security Act:</strong><br />
Society—through the national government—was responsible.</p>
<p><strong>The Social Security Act profoundly changed who was responsible for the welfare of citizens unable to support themselves.</strong><br />
The Social Security Act conferred on citizens a <strong>new right</strong>: The right to a minimum standard of welfare.<br />
The Social Security Act required of the national government a <strong>new responsibility</strong>: To provide a minimum standard of welfare for its citizens.</p>

<p><strong>Some Facts about Social Security:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Old age pensions are financed by taxes on workers and employers: 1% in 1937; rising to 3% in 1949. Today the tax rate is 7.65% on wages below $118,500.</li>
<li>The Social Security Act of 1935 excluded about half the population, including farmers, domestic servants, and workers in businesses with fewer than 10 employees.</li>
<li>Agricultural and domestic workers were not covered by Social Security until the 1950s when the system approached universal coverage.</li>
<li>On January 17, 1940, Ida M. Fuller, 76 years old and a resident of Vermont, received the first Social Security check in the amount of $41.30.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., The Coming of the New Deal (Houghton Mifflin, 1959)</strong><br />
&quot;No government bureau ever directly touched the lives of so many millions of Americans—the old, the jobless, the sick, the needy, the mothers, the children ... The federal government was at last charged with the obligation to provide its citizens a measure of protection from the hazards and vicissitudes of life... With the Social Security Act the constitutional dedication of federal power to the general welfare began a new phase of national history.&quot;</p>
