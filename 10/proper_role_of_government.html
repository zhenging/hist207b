<ul>
<li>Both Hoover and Roosevelt used government in unprecedented ways.</li>
<li>Both aimed to achieve security and stability.</li>
<li>Both recognized the dangers of the dole.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Dividing linebetween Hoover and Roosevelt:</strong><br />
What the national government should be responsible for</p>
<p><strong>Hoover's vision of the &quot;Good Society&quot;-------Hoover's ideal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Put the national government in the background</li>
<li>Citizens step to the forefront</li>
<li>Citizens are largely responsible for the security and stability of society</li>
<li>What instrument do the citizens employ?</li>
<li>Voluntary cooperation through local institutions:family, church, civic, local government</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FDR's vision of&quot;Good Society&quot;-------FDR's ideal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Move the national government to the forefront</li>
<li>Assign a new and expansive role to the national government:</li>
<li>To shape and improve society</li>
</ul>
<p>Tindall, in a previous edition of your text, mades this important point:  &quot;Franklin Roosevelt and the New Dealers went beyond the concept of regulated capitalism by insisting that the government not simply respond to social crises but also take positive steps to avoidthemand their social effects. To this end the New Deal's various benefit programs sought to ensure a minimum level of well-being for all Americans.&quot;</p>
<p>Expand the array of interests served by the national government to include: retirees, workers, employers, farmers, consumers</p>
<p>Tindall called this in the previous edition of your text the &quot;broker state.&quot;  The term &quot;broker state&quot; refers to &quot;a powerful federal government that mediated among major interest groups.  Government's role was to act as an honest broker protecting a variety of interests, not just big business but also workers, farmers, consumers, small business, and the unemployed.&quot;</p>
<p>Contrast the &quot;broker state&quot; with what historian William Leuchtenburg calls &quot;single-interest government&quot; of 1920s.  It's ES #1 on the 1920s evidence sheet</p>
