<p><strong>James T. Patterson, &quot;The Hardening of the Cold War, 1945-1948,&quot; in Grand Expectations:The United States, 1945-1974 (Oxford, 1996)</strong></p>
<p>Possession of the Bomb nonetheless confronted Truman with difficult decisions. Should he tellStalin about it? What sort of warning, if any, should he give to the Japanese? Should such anawesome weapon be used at all in war? If so, when and under what circumstances? In copingwith the first question Truman resolved to tell Stalin no more than he had to. At Potsdam hementioned to him casually that the United States had a big new bomb but made no effort toengage him in discussion about it. Stalin, who had spies working for him, expected the newsand showed little interest. In deciding what to do with the Bomb Truman apparently ponderedthe moral questions a little more than he later cared to admit. But not very deeply, and he didnot let moral scruples stop him from his determination to drop the Bomb on Japan. At Potsdamhe warned the Japanese to surrender or face &quot;prompt and utter destruction.&quot; This was scarcelya clear warning, especially to leaders of a nation whose cities had already been devastated byfire-bombs of napalm and jellied gasoline, the most horrific of which in March had killed 100,000Tokyo civilians. When Japan did not respond to the warning, Truman made no effort topostpone the bombing of Hiroshima, which was destroyed on August 6. When Japan, confusedby what had happened, still did not surrender, the bombing of Nagasaki went off according tostanding orders, on August 9. The attacks killed an estimated 135,000 people, most of themcivilians. Another 130,000 or so died within the next five years of radiation sickness and otherbomb-related causes.</p>
<p>These decisions have naturally stimulated a vast amount of controversy and second-guessing,much of it many years after the fact. Some of Truman's critics deplore as immoral the use ofsuch weapons at all. Others argue that he could have issued more explicit warnings, waitedlonger for a Japanese response, or arranged for top Japanese leaders to see a demonstrationin an uninhabited area. Even writers who are relatively friendly to Truman can find little excusefor his refusal to reconsider standing orders to bomb a second city (Nagasaki). Still other criticsinsist that use of the bombs was unnecessary, because moderate factions among Japaneseleaders had already sent out diplomatic signals indicating a desire to surrender, providing thatthey could retain their Emperor (which Japan ultimately was allowed to do). Truman'sdefenders retort that a demonstration might not have worked, which at the least would havebeen embarrassing. At that time, moreover, the United States had only two A-bombs ready foruse. Above all, Truman insisted later that he decided to drop the bombs in order to stop thecarnage of fighting as soon as possible. His defenders cite official American estimates—basedin part on the suicidal resistance between April and June of Japanese forces in Okinawa—thata bloody land invasion of Japan (not scheduled to start until November) would otherwise havebeen necessary to end the war. The A-bombs, they claim, ended the war immediately andsaved hundreds of thousands or even millions of American and Japanese lives.</p>
<p>Use of the atomic bomb has also prompted angry and unending debates concerning Soviet-American relations. Some revisionist writers dispute Truman's claim that he authorized thebombings solely to defeat Japan as soon as possible. They argue that he wanted to force aJapanese surrender before the Soviets could make good on their promise to enter the war inthe Pacific. (As it happened, the Soviets declared war on Japan on August 8.) Ending the warquickly would help to prevent the Soviet Union from claiming important concessions in Asia.Revisionist critics add that Truman used the Bomb in order to show the Russians that theUnited States would indeed drop it against an enemy in war. That would make them respectAmerican resolve in the future. Truman, they say, should not have used the Bomb until he sawwhat the Japanese would do, especially after the much-feared Russians joined the Allied forcesagainst them. That he did not wait, revisionists conclude, indicates that he was playing AtomicDiplomacy.</p>
<p>Several conclusions seem fair concerning these heated debates. First, Truman had no seriousqualms about using the Bomb against Japan. During the months before the successful test atAlamagordo he gave only cursory attention to the counter-arguments of those scientists whoraised moral concerns. He took this position in part because the Bomb had been developedwith wartime use in mind (though not, at first, against the Japanese), and in part because theweapon was ready as of August in 1945. The majority of Truman's aides, moreover, favoreddropping it on Japan; expressed doubts about the wisdom or morality of doing so mostly camelater, after the fact. In effect, neither Truman nor his advisers resisted the powerfulbureaucratic momentum that had accumulated by mid-1945. Truman also decided as he didbecause he thought that the Japanese—whose most influential military leaders seemeddetermined to fight on—were &quot;savages, ruthless, merciless, and fanatic.&quot; Like many people in1945, the President was swept up in the passionate emotions of a long and catastrophic war.Finally, Truman felt a considerable responsibility as commander-in-chief. He believed it his dutyto put an end to the fighting--especially to American casualties—as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The decision to use the Bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was politically popular in the UnitedStates—no doubt of that. And it quickly ended the war. Amid the awful passions of the time, itis hardly surprising that Truman acted as he did. Still, revisionism persists. In retrospect, itseems clear (though this is debated) that he could have waited longer—to give the shaken andbewildered Japanese time to figure out what had happened at Hiroshima—before approvinguse of the Bomb that leveled Nagasaki. It also seems clear that he would have risked little bypostponing the bombings in order to ascertain whether Japanese moderates in Tokyo mightsucceed in their efforts to reach a peace. Postponement would also have given Truman time toassess the impact on the Japanese of Russian engagement in Asia. The land invasions, afterall, were not scheduled to take place for another three months, during which time America wasunlikely to suffer much in the way of casualties. That Truman pushed ahead, however, doesnot prove that he was playing Atomic Diplomacy with the Soviets; the best evidence suggestsinstead that he wanted to stop the fighting as soon as possible. Moreover, subsequent studiesof official Japanese decision-making suggest that most top leaders in Tokyo adamantlyopposed peace in August 1945: only the A-bombs, bringing on the intercession of EmperorHirohito, finally forced the Japanese to surrender. For these reasons, the revisionistarguments, while understandable given the horror of nuclear weapons, command only partialacceptance among scholars of the subject.</p>
