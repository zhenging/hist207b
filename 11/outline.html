<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: Historians rank FDR as the third greatest U.S. president. In the article you read on FDR, historian William Leuchenburg states that Roosevelt's high ranking rests partly &quot;on his role in leading the nation to accept the responsibilities of world power.&quot; In class we will examine FDR's efforts to lead the nation away from isolationism and toward internationalism.<br />
Below is the outline of material we will cover in class. Designated on the outline by letters A through H are FDR's efforts to lead the nation to do more to assist Britain and France in their conflict with the Fascist powers.</p>
