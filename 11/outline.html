<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: Historians rank FDR as the third greatest U.S. president. In the article you read on FDR, historian William Leuchenburg states that Roosevelt’s high ranking rests partly &quot;on his role in leading the nation to accept the responsibilities of world power.&quot; In class we will examine FDR’s efforts to lead the nation away from isolationism and toward internationalism.<br />
Below is the outline of material we will cover in class. Designated on the outline by letters A through H are FDR’s efforts to lead the nation to do more to assist Britain and France in their conflict with the Fascist powers.</p>
<p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>: Please preview this outline for World War II and briefly answer questions 1 - 5 which are underlined on this outline. Bring the completed 5 page outline to class. You’ll need it to take notes on. Be prepared for quiz questions on the material that’s underlined. You do not need to bring the other materials (map, articles, ES) to class—just the outline, which is the first 5 pages of this outline packet.</p>

<p>In October, 1941, the Reuben James, a U.S. Navy destroyer was torpedoed by a German Uboat.</p>

But FDR told Churchill that Congress would not approve a declaration of war.</p>
<p>Churchill and Roosevelt proposed to construct the post-war world according to principles outlined in the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<ul>
