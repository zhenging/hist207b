<h4>ES 1. Senator Albert J. Beveridge, &quot;The March of the Flag&quot; speech, September, 1898</h4>
<p>“Today we are raising more than we can consume. Today we are making more than we can use. Today our industrial society is congested; there are more workers than there is work; there is more capital than there is investment. We do not need more money—we need more circulation, more employment. Therefore we must find new markets for our produce, new occupation for our capital, new work for our labor. And so, while we did not need the territory taken during the past century at the time it was acquired, we do need what we have taken in 1898, and we need it now.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES 2. The American Asiatic Association, Constitution, Article II, Objects and Purposes</h4>
<p>Published in the Journal of the American Asiatic Association, I (June 10, 1899)<br />
“The objects and purposes of this Association are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To foster and safeguard the trade and commercial interests of the citizens of the United States, and others associated therewith, in the Empires of China, Japan, and Korea, and in the Philippine Islands, and elsewhere in Asia or Oceania;</li>
<li>To secure the advantages of sustained watchfulness and readiness for action, attainable by union and permanent organization, in respect of such Asiatic trade, and as well in matters of legislation, or treaties affecting the same;</li>
</ol>
<h4>ES 3. Tindall on Social Darwinism, pp. 710 - 711 and p. 747</h4>
<p>Social Darwinists argued that human society and institutions, like plant and animal species, passed through the process of natural selection, which resulted in what they called “the survival of the fittest.”<br />
Claims of racial superiority bolstered the new imperialist spirit. Spokesmen in each Western country, including the United States, used the arguments of social Darwinism to justify economic exploitation and territorial conquest. Among nations as among individuals, expansionists claimed, the fittest survive and prevail.<br />
Josiah Strong, a Congregationalist minister claimed that the Anglo-Saxon was “divinely commissioned to be, in a peculiar sense, his brother’s keeper.”</p>
<h4>ES 4. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, &quot;Our Blundering Foreign Policy,&quot; Forum Magazine, 1895</h4>
<p>&quot;The tendency of modern nations is toward consolidation; small states are of the past and have no future. The great nations are rapidly absorbing for their future expansion and their present defense all the waste places of the earth. It is a movement which makes for civilization and advancement of the race. As one of the great nations of the world, the United States must not fall out of the line of the march.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES5. Josiah Strong, Our Country, 1885</h4>
<p>&quot;This race of unequalled energy, with all the majesty of numbers and wealth behind it--the representative, let us hope, of the largest liberty, the purest Christianity, the highest civilization--having developed peculiarly aggressive traits . . . will spread itself over the earth.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES6. Tindall on the economic motive for sympathizing with the Cuban rebellion, previous edition</h4>
<p>The growing economic interest in their island neighbor made Americans sympathetic to the idea of Cuban independence.</p>
<h4>ES7. Tindall on Spanish misrule in Cuba, previous edition</h4>
<p>In 1896 the Spanish commander Weyler adopted a policy of gathering Cubans behind Spanish lines, often in detention (redoncentrado) centers so that no one could join the insurrections by night and appear peaceful by day. In some of these centers, poor food and unsanitary conditions soon brought a heavy toll of disease and death. The American press promptly christened the Spanish commander “Butcher” Weyler.</p>
<h4>ES8. Tindall on Americans’ motives, previous edition</h4>
<p>Until the 1890s a nagging ambivalence about acquiring overseas territories had checked America’s drive to expand. Suddenly, in 1898 and 1899, the inhibitions collapsed, but not in a quest for bases and trade. Rather, the chief motive was a sense of outrage at another country’s imperialism.</p>
<h4>ES9. American Anti-Imperialist League</h4>
<p>We urge that Congress concede to the Philippines the independence for which they have so long fought and which by right is theirs.<br />
We denounce the slaughter of the Filipinos as a needless horror. We demand the immediate cessation of the war against liberty in the Philippines, begun by Spain and continued by us.</p>
<h4>ES10. Tindall on President McKinley, previous edition</h4>
<p>Still, it is fair to ask why McKinley did not take a stand for peace, knowing what he did. He might have defied Congress and public opinion, but in the end he deemed the political risk too high. The ultimate blame for the war, if blame must be levied, belongs to the American people for letting themselves be whipped up into such a hostile frenzy.</p>
<h4>ES11. Ivan Musicant, Empire by Default: The Spanish-American war and the Dawn of the American Century (Holt, 1998)</h4>
<p>“In dealing with the Cuban crisis prior to the war, both Grover Cleveland and William McKinley initially held a single purpose uppermost: to avert any international tangles that could upset the flow of the nation’s business, still emerging from the depression of 1893. When the Cuban problem, by now afflicting American politics and institutions, did not go away, McKinley found himself holding a bad hand. He could initiate a war with Spain or resist public opinion and risk losing Republican control of Congress. Though he was morally revolted by the cruelties of the Cuban revolution, it was domestic politics that forced McKinley ultimately to initiate hostilities with Spain. When American public emotion climbed to hysterical heights following the Maine disaster, McKinley caved to the popular will for war. At that point, neither the president nor the public at large—save large-policy expansionists—had any design beyond Cuban independence. War with monarchical, Catholic Spain had no original aim but to kick the withered Spaniard, after four hundred years, out of the Western hemisphere.<br />
But as the summer moved on and American success assumed geostrategic proportions around the globe, presidential and public aspirations underwent a sea change. The absorption of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, along with the annexation of Hawaii, was an attempt to construct an empire, but one that differed from the colonial chattels of the European powers—an altruistic export of American politics, ideals, and morality. This, however, stood side by side with one of the standard excuses for empire, markets, especially in Asia, for a surplus of manufactured goods pouring out of highly mechanized factories and bountiful farms.”</p>
<h4>ES12. Walter LaFeber, The American Age: United States Foreign Policy at Home and Abroad since 1750 (Norton, 1989)</h4>
<p>“The president did not want war. But he did want results that only war could bring: protecting property in Cuba, stopping the revolution before it turned sharply to the left, restoring confidence in the U.S. business community, insulating his Republican party from Democratic charges of cowardice in safeguarding U.S. interests, and giving himself a free hand to deal with the growing Asian crisis. For these reason, McKinley took the country into war in April 1898.”</p>
