<p>1. Describe and explain the components of Congess' program of Reconstruction.  What did Congress finally require of the South to be readmitted to the Union?<br />

<h3>Components of Congess' program</h3>
<h4>Body</h4>
<p>A. Joint Committee On Reconstruction<br />
In early 1866, representative Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania opened the 39th congress by instroducing a resolution to create a Joint Committee on Reconstruction. The Joint Committee was created to inquire into the condition of the states which formed the Confederate States of America, and report whether they, or any of them, are entitled to be represented in either house of Congress. There were 15 members in the committee, including 9 House members and 6 Senators, which were all Radical Republicans that favored a drastic transformation of the southern society based upone granting free slaves full citizenship rights.</p>
<p>B. 1866 Legislation (14th Amendment)<br />
The Radical Republicans challenged President Johnson, who believed in limited federal intervention in the South. On April, 1866, the Congress overrode President Johnson's veto (with 2/3 in both house and senate) and passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the first US federal law, which defined and affirmed that all citizens are equallly protected by the law.<br />
To ensure the legality of the new Civil Rights Act, the Congressional Joint Committee on Reconstruction went further and proposed in April 1866 a pathbreaking 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. It guaranteed citizenship to anyone born or naturalized in the US, except Native Americans. It also reduced representative in Congress of any southern state that deprived African Americans of the vote.</p>
<h3>Motivs of Radical Republicans</h3>
<p>The Radical Republicans, however, favored a drastic transformation of southern society based upone granting freed slaved full citizenship rights.<br />
1. Political motive. Blacks would vote republican (Because they are trying to help slaves.)<br />
2. Humanitarian motive<br />
Stevens is from Pennsylvania(Quaker state) and Charles is from Massachusetts (Puritan state), Both Quakers and Puritans believe people are equal in God's eyes.</p>
<p>3. Punishment motive<br />
As Thaddeus, the leader of the Radical Republicans, put it, &quot;the whole fabric of southern society must be changed, and never can it be done if this opportunity is lost...&quot;.</p>
