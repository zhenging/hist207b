<h4>1. Stephen Ambrose, Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad, 1863-1869 (Simon and Schuster, 2000)</h4>
<p>Together, the transcontinental railroad and the telegraph made modern America possible. Things that could not be imagined before the Civil War now became common. A nationwide stock market, for example. A continent-wide economy in which people, agricultural products, coal and minerals moved wherever someone wanted to send them, and did so cheaply and quickly. A continent-wide culture in which mail and popular magazines and books that used to cost dollars per ounce and had taken forever to get from the East to the West coast, now cost pennies and got there in a few days.</p>
<h4>2. Tindall, previous edition</h4>
<p>In the long run the federal government recovered much if not all of its investment. As farms, ranches, and towns sprouted around the rail lines, the value of the government land along the tracks skyrocketed. The railroads also hauled government freight, military personnel and equipment, and the mail. Moreover, by helping to accelerate the creation of a national market, the railroads spurred economic growth and thereby increased government revenues.</p>
<h4>3. Tindall, previous edition</h4>
<p>The first transcontinental railroads were utterly dependent on government support. They received huge loans, massive grants of “public” land taken from the Indians, and lavish cash subsidies from the federal government.<br />
The lure of enormous profits helped to corrupt the political system as the votes of politicians were “bought” with cash or shares of stock in the railroad companies. Railroad executives essentially created the modern practice of political “lobbying,” and they came to exercise a dangerous degree of influence over both the economy and the political system. As Charles Francis Adams, Jr., the head of the Union Pacific Railroad, acknowledged, “Our method of doing business is founded upon lying, cheating, and stealing—all bad things.”</p>
<h4>4. Richard White, Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America (W. W. Norton, 2011)</h4>
<p>From “History Hits the Campaign Trail,” New York Times, July 7, 2012:<br />
The transcontinental rail lines did not advance the common good. The Pacific Railroad—the combination of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific—was the product of some of the worst legislation that money could buy. Built too late to fulfill its original rationale of keeping California in the Union, it was justified by its promoters as a vehicle for conquering Indians, and helped precipitate a series of shameful and tawdry wars.<br />
The Union Pacific and Central Pacific made their promoters rich through insider dealing, but not the country nor even their investors. Both were mismanaged and corrupt; they were plagued by scandal, the Crédit Mobilier being only the most well known. They promoted disastrous developments that contributed to the destruction of the bison, the failed settlement of arid lands, the collapse of the Great Plains cattle industry and the bust of silver mining. Both were among the most hated corporations in American history.</p>
