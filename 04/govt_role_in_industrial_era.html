<h3>1. Government Played Two Roles in the Industrial Revolution</h3>
<h4>A. Government Aided Business by Promiting Economic Development</h4>
<h4>B. Government Kept Regulations And Restrain On Business To A Minimum</h4>
<p>The late nineteenth century is often characterized as an era of minimal national government intervention is tghe economy and society. Laissez-faire is the name often given to the policy that the national government should take a hand-off approach to economic and social problems.</p>
<p><strong>Why was the case? Consider the following two factors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Citizens expected very little of the national government. Consequently, the national government had yet to assume many of the responsibilities we take for granted today. For example: national government regulation of the environment, the workplace, the food and drug supply, and the national government's responsibility for the welfare of groups such as the poor and elderly would not be established until the twentieth century.<br />
So what did the national government do in the late nineteenth century?<br />
Not much more than deliver mail, collect taxes (but not the income tax since it didn't exist until the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913), fight Native Americans, guard the coasts, and preserve order.<br />
The number of national government employees in 1871 was about 50,000. Today it is over 2.5 million.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An idea called Social Darwinism led many Americans to believe that government interference in the processes of social and economic change was a serious mistake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ideas matter in history</strong>. Study Tindall's explanation of <strong>Social Darwinism</strong> on pages 710 - 712. Be sure you know why Social Darwinism was significant.</p>
<p>There is an important exception to the broad generalization that the late nineteenth century was an era of laissez-faire, or non-intervention by the national government.<br />
In 1887, Congress created the <strong>Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)</strong>.<br />
The ICC was the first independent federal (meaning national government) regulatory commission. Today, there are dozens of these regulatory commissions, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Labor Relations Board.<br />
The ICC was an attempt by Congress to impose national government restraints on the private power of the railroads. Farmers had demanded that the national government protect them from unfair pricing and other practices by the railroads.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Please think about the following questions:<br />
1. What's significant about the national government keeping regulations and restraints on business to a minimum during the late nineteenth century?<br />
2. How did the hands-off position of the national government shape the course of the industrial revolution?</p>
