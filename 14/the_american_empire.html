<p>By John G. Stoessinger</p>
<h5>Johnson's Personal War</h5>
<p>Not only did Lyndon Johnson perceive Vietnam through the lenses of World War II, but he also perceived it as a personal challenge, a threat to his manhood and virility. The dangers of appeasement were clear enough to him. &quot;If we quit in Vietnam,&quot; he said, &quot;tomorrow we'll be fighting in Hawaii and next week we'll be fighting in San Francisco.&quot; But the challenge was sexual as well. &quot;If you let a bully come into your front yard one day,&quot; he explained, &quot;the next day he'll be up on your porch and the day after he'll rape your wife in your own bed.&quot; It was this intensely personal challenge that made Johnson's conduct of the war unique. He saw himself, Western-style, locked in a shoot-out with Ho Chi Minh. No American war had ever been fought in such a personal way by an American president before.</p>
<p>Johnson's initial commitment to the war was already perceived in personal terms. &quot;I am not going to lose Vietnam,&quot; he declared in 1964, &quot;I am not going to be the President who saw Southeast Asia go the way China went.&quot;By 1965, Johnson was speaking of &quot;my Security Council,&quot; &quot;my State Department,&quot; &quot;my troops.&quot; It was his war, his struggle; when the Vietcong attacked, they attacked him . On one occasion, a young soldier, escorting him to an army helicopter, said: &quot;This is your helicopter, sir.&quot; &quot;They are all my helicopters, son,&quot; Johnson replied.</p>
<p>On February 7, 1965, the Vietcong attacked the American adviser's barracks at Pleiku. Nine Americans were killed and sixty were wounded. Johnson responded immediately by authorizing air strikes against four targets in North Vietnam. &quot;I've had enough of this,&quot; he said. &quot;This is just like the Alamo; someone damn well needs to go to their aid; well, by God, I'm going to Vietnam's aid.&quot; Discussing his decision with the National Security Council, he said: &quot;We have kept our guns over the mantel and our shells in the cupboard for a long time now. And what was the result? They are killing our men while they sleep in the night.&quot; &quot;The Vietcong,&quot; he continued, &quot;actually thought that pressure on an American President would be so great that he'd pull out of Vietnam. They don't know the President of the United States. He's not pulling out!&quot; Johnson failed to point out that the American troops were on Vietnamese territory, having been sent to help the South Vietnamese fight the Communists for the right to rule that territory. Instead, in Johnson's mind, Pleiku was like the Alamo.</p>
<p>On the following day, Johnson received a unanimous recommendation for the sustained bombing of North Vietnam. The six signatories were Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Special Assistant McGeorge Bundy, and Generals Maxwell Taylor, William Westmoreland, and Earle Wheeler. &quot;The international prestige of the United States and a substantial part of our influence are directly at risk inVietnam,&quot; the report stated. A policy of &quot;sustained reprisal&quot; was therefore indicated. Undersecretary of State George Ball disagreed. South Vietnam was not vital to America's national security, he declared. If we did nothing, its collapse would not be serious. If escalation was tried and failed, however-and he believed that failure was quite likely-then the consequences would be profoundly serious. France had almost collapsed under the weight of her failure in Vietnam. An old Eisenhower aide, Emmett John Hughes, asked Bundy what he would do if the North Vietnamese retaliated by matching the American air escalation with their own ground escalation. &quot;We can't assume what we don't believe,&quot; Bundy replied.</p>
<p>A few words should be said here about Johnson's relationships with his advisers. He was not, as some scholars have argued, the prisoner of a bureaucratic structure that deceived him into escalation. His circle of advisers was extremely small and he overwhelmed almost all of them with the sheer force of his personality. They sensed what he wanted to hear and gave it to him. In an atmosphere where access to the president was the coin of the realm, nothing less would do. Johnson wanted men around him he could trust. &quot;How loyal is that man?&quot; he asked a White House staffer about an applicant for a high-level position in 1965. &quot;Well, he seems quite loyal, Mr. President,&quot; the staffer said. &quot;I don't want loyalty. I want loyalty . I want him to kiss my ass in Macy's window at high noon and tell me it smells like roses,&quot; Johnson shouted. &quot;I want his pecker in my pocket.&quot; Dean Rusk was his secretary of state, Bundy and McNamara were his intellectuals, and Taylor, Westmoreland, and Wheeler were his generals.</p>
<p>Typically, when a Vietnam decision was to be made, Johnson would bring together a small group and achieve a consensus by polling each man in turn. In The Lost Crusade , Chester Cooper tells how he used to feel when one of Johnson's polling sequences got under way in the National Security Council:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the process would frequently fall into a Walter Mitty-like fantasy: When my turn came, I would rise to my feet slowly, look around the room and then directly at the President, and say very quietly and emphatically, &quot;Mr. President, gentlemen, I most definitely do not agree.&quot; But I was removed from my trance when I heard the President's voice saying, &quot;Mr. Cooper, do you agree?&quot; And out would come a &quot;Yes, Mr. President, I agree.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Johnson had wanted different advice, or a wider range of opinion, he could have changed his group of advisers. He could have dismissed Dean Rusk and made George Ball secretary of state. He could have replaced McNamara and Bundy. He did not. He did not have advisers to seek advice, but to elicit emotional support for his personal beliefs. And his advisers were indeed supportive. McNamara considered victory through air bombardment as technologically feasible. Bundy made it intellectually respectable; and Rusk thought of it as historically necessary. Johnson was not above humiliating his advisers. He would make Bundy deliver papers to him while in an open-door bathroom. &quot;Mac, I can't hear you,&quot; he would shout, &quot;Mac, get closer, Mac, get in here!&quot; Once, when he was berating George Ball and Robert McNamara, Dean Acheson stopped him with these words: &quot;Mr. President, you don't pay these men enough to talk to them that way-even with a federal pay raise.&quot; And when Walt Rostow moved into his inner circle of advisers, he exclaimed triumphantly: &quot;I'm getting Walt Rostow as my intellectual. He's not Bundy's intellectual. He's not Galbraith's intellectual. He's not Schlesinger's intellectual. He's going to be my goddamn intellectual and I'm going to have him by the short hairs.&quot;</p>
<p>Lyndon Johnson was not led by these men. In the most fundamental sense, he led and even dominated them. It must be remembered that the members of the White House staff possessed no independent constituencies off their own and were completely dependent upon the president. He alone had the power to appoint, promote, or fire them. Compelled to explain their actions to no one but the man at the top, the president's advisers tended to become mirrors of their chief. In George Reedy's words: &quot;No White House assistant could stay in the President's graces for and considerable period without renouncing his own ego.&quot; With increasing dependence came increasing submission, even sycophancy. In some cases, the dynamics resemble a folie a duex, a psychological phenomenon in which strong, overbearing personalities are able to make others accept their own delusional systems. In the words of Doris Kearns: &quot;The White House machinery became the President's psyche writ large, transmitting his wishes throughout the Executive Office with a terrifying force.&quot; Even strong personalities like Bundy and McNamara were not exempt. Weak men were humiliated mercilessly. Johnson was in the habit of putting up his feet on Jack Valenti's lap, using it as a stool in front of visiting dignitaries. Nonetheless, Valenti declared in a public speech was widely ridiculed, Valenti was surprised. &quot;What did they expect me to do?&quot; he asked, &quot;denounce the President?&quot; Lyndon Johnson ruled the White House like a monarch with his advisers as his court.</p>
<p>This is how, in early, 1965, the bombing campaign or &quot;Operation Rolling Thunder,&quot; as it was referred to in The Pentagon Papers , got under way. In Johnson's view, the bombing was a form of bargaining without words, seduction rather than rape. As he put it, &quot;I saw our bombs as my political resources for negotiating a peace. On the other hand, our planes and our bombs could be used as carrots for the South, strengthening the morale of the South Vietnamese. On the other hand, our bombs could be used as sticks against the North, pressuring North Vietnam to stop its aggression against the South.&quot;</p>
<p>When the bombing failed to improve the situation, Johnson responded by enlarging the size of both sticks and carrots. He approved more targets for more intensive bombing raids, but he also offered a new inducement: a billion dollar project for the social and economic betterment of both Vietnams. If only North Vietnam would &quot;leave its neighbors alone: he said, he was prepared to &quot;turn the Mekong into a Tennessee Valley.&quot; Johnson now promised the reconstruction of the country even as his orders brought mounting destruction. The bombs were meant to destroy the Ho Chi Minh trail, which was the major infiltration route leading from North to South Vietnam. But the bombs also destroyed the forests that were vital to the organic layer of the soil; the defoliants did not distinguish between jungles and crops; and forced migration from the countryside to the cities tore peasants from villages where they had lived for generations. &quot;We will help the Vietnamese to stabilize the economy,&quot; he promised, &quot;to increase the production of goods, to spread the light of education and stamp out disease.&quot; All this destruction, in short, was necessary for the salvation of the Vietnamese.</p>
<p>As 1965 wore on, it became clear that the bombing program was useless. Ho Chi Minh did exactly what McGeorge Bundy had been unwilling to assume: he matched every American bombing escalation with a ground escalation of his own. As Johnson escalated the bombing program, he got into the habit of approving every target personally. Tracing his fingers across a map of Vietnam, he would point to various potential targets-railroad bridges, army barracks, oil-storage depots, airfields, factories-demanding to know the costs and benefits of attacking each one. &quot;How many tons of bombs will it take to destroy this?&quot; he would ask while waving a photograph of a railroad bridge. He feared that if he went beyond a certain point, he would trigger a secret treaty that the North Vietnamese had signed with the Soviet Union or with China. &quot;I never knew,&quot; he said, &quot;as I sat there in the afternoon approving targets one, two, three whether one of these three might just be the one to set off the provisions of those secret treaties. In the dark of night, I would lay awake picturing my boys flying around North Vietnam, asking myself an endless series of questions. What if one of those targets you picked today triggers off Russia or China?&quot; &quot;I couldn't stand it anymore,&quot; he confided in Doris Kearns, &quot;I jumped out of bed, put on my robe, took my flashlight, and went into the Situation Room.&quot; There he would receive reports about completed missions. A giant map on the wall indicated which strikes had destroyed what targets. Actually, much of the time, the bombers, flying over hundreds of villages and hamlets, were unable to separate enemies from innocents, or soldiers from civilians. Often, a large area was saturated with bombs to compensate for the difficulties of accurate aim. Usually, entire villages were thus destroyed, just to make sure that the target was also hit. It was like weeding a garden with a bulldozer. Gradually, large sections of North and South Vietnam were so pockmarked with craters that they began to resemble a moonscape.</p>
<p>The introduction of American troops took place in a succession of easy incremental steps. In March 1965, General Westmoreland, the commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam, requested a few troops to protect the air base near Da Nang from which American air strikes were launched. Johnson promptly approved the request and on March 10, two Marine battalions-fifteen hundred men-landed in Vietnam. A few weeks later, Westmoreland submitted a second request for more troops. Johnson approved this request too, in order to &quot;protect his boys,&quot; the same &quot;boys&quot; who were originally there to protect the airfield. By April, more than 50,000 American soldiers were in Vietnam. Missions expanded as numbers increased. The original mission of the troops was simply to protect air bases. In April, American troops were permitted active participation in combat if a nearby Vietnamese unit was in serious trouble. By May, permission had been granted to commit American troops to full-scale combat.</p>
<p>As the number of American troops reached 50,000, some senators became a trifle uneasy. They were quickly reassured by Vice-President Hubert Humphrey who said: &quot;There are people at State and the Pentagon who want to send three-hundred thousand men out there. But the President will never get sucked into anything like that.&quot; In May, the troop figure was revised to more than 50,000. George Ball was appalled, but could not reverse the trend. He was virtually alone in his resistance. In July, five months after the initiation of the bombing, McNamara, Bundy, Rusk, Taylor, and Westmoreland presented the president with three options: one, cut losses and withdraw; two, continue fighting at current levels; three substantially expand the military pressure. The memo revealed a preference for the third option. Johnson, not surprisingly, chose option three and authorized the raising of troop levels to 200,000 men. Thus, without consulting the Congress, he crossed the Rubicon and turned Vietnam into a major American war.</p>
<p>In the words of one thoughtful observer, Johnson made this decision as a response &quot;to a personal challenge from Ho. If Ho wanted a challenge, a test of wills, then he had come to the right man. Lyndon Johnson of Texas would not be pushed around. He was a man to stand tall when the pressure was there. To be counted. He would show Ho his mettle, show the toughness of this country.&quot;</p>
<p>There was, of course, the troublesome question of paying the bill. The president's advisers recommended that Johnson ask the Congress for higher taxes to pay for the war, issue a presidential declaration of a &quot;state of emergency,&quot; put the economy on a wartime footing, and order the mobilization of 235,000 reservists. Johnson rejected this course of action. Going to Congress meant admitting that the country was involved in a major war that would demand major sacrifices. This would imperil his plans for the Great Society. Johnson therefore decided to tell Congress and the public no more than was absolutely necessary. He would request an additional appropriation of only $1.8 billion, thus deferring the full revelation of the war's mounting costs until the following year. He would announce only that 50,000 new troops were to be sent immediately and would extend enlistments and increase draft calls rather than mobilize the reserves. In short, Johnson now clearly opted for a full-scale, though covert, war in Asia. This course of concealment and deception was decided by the president alone. It was difficult to imagine another president, even in the same situation, making the same choice. Clark Clifford, who sat in the meetings as a friend of the president and as a member of the intelligence advisory board, sounded an ominous warning. &quot;I see catastrophe ahead for my country,&quot; he declared. &quot;We have learned from Hitler at Munich that success only feeds the appetite for aggression,&quot; the president responded. &quot;We did not choose to be the guardians at the gate, but there is no one else.&quot;</p>
<p>The die was cast and General Westmoreland now began to occupy center stage. Whatever &quot;Westy&quot; requested, Johnson approved. The general had estimated that &quot;only&quot; 300,000 troops would be needed by the end of 1966. He quickly revised that figure to 400,000, however, and projected a probably figure of close to 600,000 men by the end of 1967. It turned out that he had hoped that North Vietnam would not commit major reinforcements if the United States upped the ante. This hope proved to be illusory. Ho Chi Minh matched each American escalation with one of his own. Thus, it was North Vietnam, not the United States that controlled the rate of the war. It could escalate or de-escalate the tempo by deciding how many of its own men to send into battle at a given time. When Harrison Salisbury of the New York Times visited Hanoi in December 1966, he was told by a North Vietnamese leader: &quot;And how long do you Americans want to fight? One year? Two years? Three years? Five years? Ten years? Twenty years? We will be glad to accommodate you.&quot; Thus, the war raged on, but despite massive infusions of new combat troops, the American position steadily deteriorated. Even though South Vietnamese or American troops would capture a village during the day, the Vietcong usually came back at night and did as well as before. A reporter asked McNamara whether Vietnam did not resemble a bottomless pit. &quot;Every pit has its bottom,&quot; McNamara answered.</p>
<p>As 1966 and 1967 wore on and troop level gradually reached 500,000 men, failure began to take its toll. One by one, the intellectuals departed. In 1966, McGeorge Bundy left and was replaced by Walt Rostow who was an enthusiastic supporter of the war and a fervent believer in an eventual American victory. In 1976, McNamara became increasingly ambivalent and recommended a bombing halt. The president refused to give in. &quot;A bombing halt,&quot; he would say, &quot;I'll tell you what happens when there is a bombing halt: I halt and then Ho Chi Minh shows his trucks right up to my ass. That's your bombing halt.&quot; A few months before he left the Defense Department, McNamara authorized a comprehensive study of all materials pertaining to Vietnam, going back to the 1940s. When he read the first few chapters of these &quot;Pentagon Papers,&quot; he told a friend they could hang for people what's in there.&quot; His successor was Clark Clifford who, two years before, had predicted catastrophe for the United States in Indochina.</p>
<p>The White House now began to resemble a fortress under siege. Johnson's gigantic ego, pride, and machismo made it impossible for him to admit that he had made a colossal mistake. If he ever evinced any doubts, if he ever admitted the truth even to himself, it would become a reality. Hence, he fought the truth and sought comfort in charts and statistics that predicted victory. He simply could not lose and thus had to plunge onward. Gradually, critics became enemies and enemies became traitors. Anybody who voiced doubts about the war soon lost access to the president. By late 1967, only Rostow and Valenti enjoyed Johnson's complete trust. Valenti was a total sycophant and Rostow was, according to an aide, &quot;like Rasputin to a tsar under siege.&quot;</p>
<p>A word should be said at this juncture about peace negotiations. After all, Johnson had claimed that the main purpose of the bombing of North Vietnam was to force its leaders to the negotiating table. Actually, a carefully documented case has been made that the president's behavior showed a &quot;somber, recurring pattern of political exploration cut short by American military escalation.&quot; In other words, Johnson repeatedly responded to possibilities of negotiations by raising the level of killing in Vietnam. In 1964, General de Gualle called for a new meeting of the Geneva Conference that had led to an Indochina agreement in 1954. Johnson categorically rejected this proposal. Between 1964 and 1967, United Nations Secretary General U Thant made at least two dozen efforts to get the Americans together with the North Vietnamese for talks. On one such occasion, in February 1965, a meeting was actually arranged in Rangoon, Burma, but Johnson cancelled at the last minute since he was worried that &quot;any rumors of such a meeting might topple the Saigon government.&quot; U Thant, at a press conference submitted the following sad report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am sure that the great American people, if only they knew the true facts will agree with me that further bloodshed is unnecessary. The political and diplomatic methods of discussions and negotiations alone can create conditions which will enable the United States to withdraw gracefully from that part of the world. As you know, in times of war and of hostilities, the first casualty is truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As casualties mounted, Senator J. William Fulbright began hearings on the war in Vietnam. Johnson broke with his old friend and became increasingly incensed at Senator Robert F. Kennedy who, too, had turned against the war. In April 1967, he brought General Westmoreland had 470,000 American troops and was asking for an increase that would bring the total to 680,000 men by June 1968. And even with this increase, there was no end in sight. Instead, the United States had dropped more than seven million tons of bombs on Indochina. This was equal to three hundred of the atomic bombs that fell on Japan in 1945. The bombs had left twenty million craters. America, too, was in anguish over the war. The president had lost respect in the eyes of an entire generation, universities were disrupted, careers were blighted, and the economy was bloated with war inflation. More and more metal caskets bearing the remains of dead Americans came back from Indochina. And still, Johnson would not yield. He began to resort to violent name calling. Lunches and dinners were dominated by complaints about the &quot;traitors.&quot; He saw conspiracies everywhere. By late 1967, the barriers separating irrational thought from delusion were crumbling. Members of the White House staff were frightened by what seemed to them signs of paranoia. Besides, Vietnam was devouring the president's popular support. As casualties began to hit American homes everywhere, opposition to the war mounted steadily. When Johnson had begun his presidency by 1963, eight out of ten Americans-as measured by the Gallup poll's question-&quot;Do you approve or disapprove of the way the President is handling their job?&quot;-approved of his actions. By the end of 1964, his level of support dropped to seven out of ten. By 1965, it was down to six out of ten; by 1966, to five out of ten, and by 1967, to four out of ten. In other words, with each year in office Johnson lost on supporter in ten. Nonetheless, he stuck to his illusions. The folie a deux continued. For the New Year's Eve party at the American embassy in Saigon in 1967, the invitations read: &quot;Come see the light at the end of the tunnel.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, after three years of persisting in the same disastrous policy, Lyndon Johnson decided on March 31, 1968, both to de-escalate the air war and to withdraw from politics. Three events occurred that, at long last, changed the president's mind: the &quot;Tet&quot; offensive, the presidential primaries, and the influence of the new defense secretary, Clark Clifford.</p>
<p>The &quot;Tet&quot; offensive, which began in late January 1968, at the time of the Vietnamese New Year, completely destroyed Johnson's and Westmoreland's credibility. In the past, the Vietcong and North Vietnamese had always fought a guerrilla war in the jungles, striking quickly and slipping back into the night. In the &quot;Tet&quot; offensive, they deliberately changed that strategy and fought in the cities. This meant that millions of Americans watching television now became witness to the enemy's toughness, resilience, and failure to collapse according to American timetables. In the space of six weeks, between late January and early March of 1968, the percentage of Americans who approved of Johnson's handling of the war dropped from 40 to 26 percent. Even as General Giap launched his offensive in Vietnam, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota campaigned in New Hampshire. To Johnson's consternation, McCarthy won 42 percent of the vote and pushed Robert Kennedy into the race for presidency. What crumbled in Saigon now crumbled in Washington and New Hampshire. Nonetheless, Johnson remained obstinate. As last as March 16, 1968, he told his staff:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's get one thing clear! I'm telling you now I am not going to stop the bombing. Now I don't want to hear any more about it. I've heard every argument. I'm not going to stop it. Now, is there anybody here who doesn't understand that?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By now most of the intellectuals had turned against the war. Daniel Ellsberg who had been in the Marine Corps and had done some early planning on the war under John McNuaghton in the Defense Department, symbolized this conversion. As Ellsberg gradually turned against the war, an old friend asked him: &quot;Are you the Dan Ellsberg I used to know in college?&quot; &quot;I haven't been for a long time, but I am again,&quot; Ellsberg was reported to have replied.</p>
<p>Defense Secretary Clark Clifford was not a man whom Johnson could dismiss as a &quot;lightweight intellectual.&quot; When McGeorge Bundy had left, Johnson ascribed his quitting to his greater loyalty to the dead John Kennedy. When Robert McNamara left, Johnson blamed the decision on McNamara's friendship with Robert Kennedy. But none of these motives could explain Clifford's shift. He was neither dissenter nor turncoat but an emissary from the corporate world of financial interest and political power. When Clifford patiently explained that businessmen and opinion leaders across the nation felt that the United States was sinking deeper and deeper into a hopeless bog, Lyndon Johnson was shaken. He knew now that he was losing the support of the rich and powerful, the barons of his realm. The herald had finally arrived and the walls were crumbling.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Johnson struggled with himself literally to the last minute. As he put it in The Vantage Point : &quot;When did I make the decisions that I announce the evening of March 31, 1968? The answer is: 9:01 P.M. on March 31, 1968.&quot; And he added a typical personal, proprietary note: &quot;I have 525,000 men whose very lives depend on what I do, and I must not be worried about primaries. I must be working full time for those men out there.&quot; And so, there was to be no light at the end of the tunnel for Lyndon Johnson. Vietnam had made the man elected by one of the largest landslides in American history into a one-term president. The cycle had been completed. His massive ego had locked him into an increasingly rigid posture: calculated deceit became self-deception; self-deception became delusion; but finally, there was a limit even to Johnson's insulation and reality came back into play. Faced with a precipitous drop in public standing and the loss of support from key interest group leaders, he finally accepted the fact that the situation had moved beyond his control. He now had no choice but to withdraw. Perhaps his withdrawal might enable him to exercise a measure of control over another constituency: that of history.</p>
<p>After his retirement from politics, Lyndon Johnson spent much more time on his cattle ranch in Stonewall, Texas, than on his memoirs or in public arenas. Old habits could not be easily abandoned. Perhaps the most poignant, even terrifying, part of Doris Kearns's brilliant portrait is Johnson's life on his ranch. He ran the ranch exactly the way he had run the Vietnam war. Control that had once spanned the world was now reduced to a pitiful domain. For hours every day, Johnson would drive around the fields checking up on his men, finding tasks undone, spotting problems, talking with field hands about the cattle or the tractors. At morning meetings, he would deliver his instructions to the hands with the same tone of voice and with the same urgency that he had communicated at early morning staff meetings at the White House. &quot;I want each of you to make a solemn pledge,&quot; he said to the hands, &quot;that you will not go to bed tonight until you are sure that every steer has everything he needs.&quot; When the rains failed to come, he announced that he hadn't slept all night and ordered that special pumps be shipped to him by air. &quot;I kept thinking about those pump parts and about the rain and about my fields. And I couldn't stand it. I must have those parts before the end of the day. I simply must. If I don't, everything's going to fall apart. Everything.&quot; And when the pumps arrived on time, Johnson was triumphant. &quot;Now for the first time, I've got reasonable confidence I'm not going to fail,&quot; he said, &quot;We will have two hundred head of cattle, well fed and ready to sell by October. It's going to work. Thank God. I feel better tonight than I can remember feeling in a long time.&quot; All the skills, all the tools shaped over decades of public life, were now directed at four or five field hands. Work on the ranch consumed what was left of Lyndon Johnson's energies. On January 22, 1973, he died there, alone.</p>
