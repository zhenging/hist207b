<h4>Study Questions</h4>
<p>In statements 1–4, look for common themes, particularly regarding the domino theory and the nature of the U.S. commitment to South Vietnam.</p>
<p>Contrast statements 2-5 with statement 6.Robert McNamara, quoted in #6, was President Johnson's Secretary of Defense and the architect of the US military build-up in South Vietnam.</p>
<h4>ES1. Harry Truman, Address to a Joint Session of Congress, March 12, 1947</h4>
<p>&quot;At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one.</p>
<p>One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression.</p>
<p>The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms.</p>
<p>I believe that it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES2. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Press Conference, April 7, 1954</h4>
<p><strong>Q. Robert Richards, Copley Press</strong>:<br />
&quot;Mr. President, would you mind commenting on the strategic importance of Indochina to the free world? I think there has been, across the country, some lack of understanding on just what it means to us.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>A. President Dwight D. Eisenhower</strong>:<br />
&quot;Finally you have the broader considerations that might follow what you would call the ‘falling domino' principle. You have a row of dominoes set up, you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly. So you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES3. John F. Kennedy, NBC's &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report,&quot; September 9, 1963</h4>
<p><strong>Q.Mr. Brinkley</strong>:<br />
&quot;Mr. President, have you had any reason to doubt this so-called ‘domino theory,' that if South Vietnam falls, the rest of southeast Asia will go behind it?&quot;<br />
<strong>A.President John F. Kennedy</strong>:<br />
&quot;No, I believe it. I believe it. I think that the struggle is close enough. China is so large, looms so high just beyond the frontiers, that if South Vietnam went, it would not only give them an improved geographic position for a guerilla assault on Malaya, but would also give the impression that the wave of the future in southeast Asia was China and the Communists. So I believe it.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES4. Lyndon Johnson, Address at Johns Hopkins University, &quot;Peace Without Conquest,&quot; April 7, 1965</h4>
<p>&quot;Why are we in South Vietnam? We are ther e because we have a promise to keep. Since 1954 every American President has offered support to the people of South Vietnam. We have helped to build and we have helped to defend. Thus, over many years, we have made a national pledge to help South Vietnam defend its independence...</p>
<p>We are also there to strengthen world order. Around the globe, from Berlin to Thailand, are people whose well-being rests, in part, on the belief that they can count on us if they are attacked. To leave Vietnam to its fate would shake the confidence of all these people in the value of American commitment and in the value of America's word. The result would be increased unrest and instability, and even wider war...</p>
<p>&quot;Our objective is the independence of South Vietnam, and its freedom from attack. We want nothing for ourselves—only that the people of South Vietnam be allowed to guide their own country in their own way. We will do everything necessary to reach that objective. And we will do only what is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>In recent months attacks on South Vietnam were stepped up. Thus, it became necessary for us to increase our response and to make attacks by air. ...We do this to convince the leaders of North Vietnam—and all who seek to share their conquest—of a very simple fact: We will not be defeated. We will not grow tired. We will not withdraw, either openly or under the cloak of a meaningless agreement...</p>
<p>Our resources are equal to any challenge. Because we fight for values and we fight for principles, rather than [for] territories or colonies, our patience and our determination are unending.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES5. Dean Rusk, Secretary of State, Memo to President Johnson, July 1, 1965</h4>
<p>The integrity of the U.S. commitment is the principal pillar of peace throughout the world. If that commitment becomes unreliable, the communist world would draw conclusions that would lead to our ruin and almost certainly to a catastrophic war... We cannot abandon [South Vietnam}without disaster to peace and to our interests throughout the world.</p>
<h4>ES6. Robert S. McNamara, In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam(Vintage Books, 1995)</h4>
<p>I believe we could and should have withdrawn from South Vietnam either in late 1963 amid the turmoil following Diem's assassination or in late 1964 or early 1965 in the face of increasing political and military weakness in South Vietnam...</p>
<p>I do not believe that U.S. withdrawal at any of these junctures, if properly explained to the American people and to the world, would have led West Europeans to question our support for NATO and, through it, our guarantee of their security. Nor do I believe that Japan would have viewed our security treaties as any less credible. On the contrary, it is possible we would have improved our credibility by withdrawing from Vietnam and saving our strength for more defensible stands elsewhere...</p>
<p>We of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations who participated in the decisions on Vietnam acted according to what we thought were the principles and traditions of this nation. We made our decisions in light of those values. Yet we were wrong, terribly wrong. We owe it to future generations to explain why.</p>
<h4>ES7. William H. Chafe, The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II(Oxford, 1999)</h4>
<p>In all likelihood, the peace accords that were finally signed in January 1973 could have been negotiated four years earlier. In the name of credibility, honor, and patriotism hundreds of thousands of lives had been lost. At best, Nixon's secret plan represented the acting out of a bully's fantasies. At worst, it represented a criminal abuse of human rights that in the eyes of some was the equivalent of genocide.</p>
<h4>ES8. Tindall on Nixon's handling of the Vietnam War, previous edition</h4>
<p>By the time a settlement was reached, in 1973, another 20,000 Americans had died, the morale of the American army had been shattered, millions of Asians had been killed or wounded, and fighting was continuing in Southeast Asia. In the end, Nixon's policy gained little that the president could not have accomplished in 1969.</p>
<h4>ES9. Tindall on why the U.S. lost the Vietnam War, previous edition</h4>
<p>America's goal was not to win the war in a conventional sense by capturing enemy territory, but to prevent the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong from winning and, eventually, to force a negotiated settlement with the North Vietnamese. This meant that America would have to maintain a military presence as long as the enemy retained the will to fight.</p>
<p>As it turned out, American public support for the war eroded faster than the will of the North Vietnamese leaders to tolerate devastating casualties and destruction.</p>
<p>In a war of political will, North Vietnam had the advantage. Johnson and his advisers grievously underestimated the tenacity of North Vietnam's commitment to unify Vietnam and expel the United States.</p>
