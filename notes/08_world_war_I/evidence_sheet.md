## EVIDENCE SHEET: World War I

#### ES1. Woodrow Wilson, 1910
"We are chosen, and prominently chosen, to show the way to the nations of the world how they shall walk in the paths of liberty."

#### ES2. Missionary Diplomacy (MD)
The American effort to seek the salvation of the world by converting nations abroad to democracy and capitalism—to remake the world in America's image.
The effort to spread American political and economic institutions abroad rests on **two beliefs**:
A. Democracy and capitalism are superior institutions and nations abroad would be better off with these institutions.
B. Democracy and capitalism within the U.S. function best in a world of similar institutions. So Americans would be better off if nations abroad adopted these institutions.

#### ES3. Woodrow Wilson, War Message to Congress, April 2, 1917
“We are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretence about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples, the German peoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience. **The world must be made safe for democracy**. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.”

#### ES4.  Woodrow Wilson, Fourteen Points Message to Congress, January 8, 1918
“What we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves. It is that the world be made fit and safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine its own institutions, be assured of justice and fair dealing by the other peoples of the world against force and selfish aggression.
All the peoples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us. The program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, as we see it, is this:
1\. Open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view.
2\. Absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants.
3\. The removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance.
4\. Adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest points consistent with domestic safety.
5\. A free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims ...
14\. A general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike."

#### ES5. Kendrick A. Clements, Woodrow Wilson: World Statesman, (Ivan R. Dee, 1999)
Whether Wilson could have secured approval of the treaty without reservations, and whether he would have been willing to compromise on such reservations are ... difficult questions. The fight was bitter, and Wilson, by now a seasoned politician, knew that a leader who offers a compromise before his back is to the wall will get less than one who holds out until the last moment... His leadership style had always been to make a case for perfection in presenting an issue to the public, but to compromise if necessary on anything other than principle. Up to the point of his stroke, the treaty fight was following that pattern.
The stroke, by stripping away his ability to discriminate between principle and detail, by destroying his more subtle intellectual abilities and thrusting him back onto the bedrock of his religious morality, destroyed his sense of what and when to compromise. Shielded by Edith (Wilson, his wife) and Grayson (his physician) from ugly reality, he saw no need for compromise, and thinking in simplistic terms of good versus evil, he was powerfully driven to avoid doing so. The statesman became the moralist, and as such he was no match for Lodge/

#### ES6. Thomas A. Bailey, Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal, (McMillan, 1945)
Thomas Marshall (Wilson’s vice-president) of course would have been president for seventeen months. Having presided over the Senate for six years, and knowing the temper of that body, he probably would have recognized the need for compromise, and probably would have worked for some reconciliation of the Democratic and Republican points of view. In these circumstances it seems altogether reasonable to suppose that the Senate would have approved the treaty with a few relatively minor reservations.

#### ES7. Conclusion
Many historians credit Wilson for:
+ Doing more than anyone else to establish the first modern association of nations
+ Establishing the goals and objectives of U.S. foreign policy in the twentieth century

Some historians criticize Wilson based on this sequence of events: (Arrows mean “led to” or “contributed to”)
+ Lodge vs. Wilson $\To$
+ No U.S. participation in L.O.N. $\To$
+ Weakened L.O.N. $\To$
+ Lack of opposition to Hitler’s remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936 $\To$
+ World War II
