## 04 Industrial Revolution

Industrial Revolution issues still around today:

### 1. Climate Change
Modern industrial society is built on fossil fuels

Burning fossil fuels = CO2 = global warming and climate change = One of the top 2 threats to life today (the other is nuclear weapons)

According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change: **Global warming since the Industrial Revolution is unprecedented over the last
800,000 years and the cause is humans burning fossil fuels.**


What _framework_ can we use to organize and interpret the events of the period 1876-1900?

What _framework_ did we use to understand Reconstruction?

Will the Reconstruction _framework_ be appropriate for the period 1876 – 1900?

### Major Theme
How America was transformed from a predominately rural and agricultural to an urban and industrial society, and what this meant for the people of the United States.

Carl N. Degler, The Age of the Economic Revolution, 1876 – 1900, (Scott, Foresman, 1977)
“The industrialization and urbanization of the United States must be included among the most important developments in the nation’s history, comparable only to the American Revolution, which established the nation’s independence, and the Civil War, which assured its survival.”

“The Economic Revolution of the last half of the nineteenth century was more than a proliferation of factories and machines; it can also be seen as a transformation of a society. Within the span of years no longer than a newborn infant takes to become an adult, a nation of small-property owners (the majority of whom were self-employed farmers) became a nation in which most men had little or no connection with the land, were largely without property, and worked for other men.”

The Industrial Revolution was driven by the interaction of its many component parts. What are some of the components of the Industrial Revolution? Think carefully about how these components of the Industrial Revolution interact with each other.

Think about the primacy of railroad expansion and a nationwide market.
The expansion of the railroads was a pivotal factor in creating a nationwide market for goods and services. This nationwide market spawned many of the features of modern industrial society: specialization of labor; the factory system; mass production; mass consumption; capital-intensive agriculture.
Tindall emphasizes the importance of the railroads and the nationwide market on
pp. 625 - 626.
“The transcontinental railroads tied the nation together, changed the economic and political landscape, and enabled the United States to emerge as a world power.”

## Government Roles: Industrial Revolution

### 1. Government Played Two Roles in the Industrial Revolution

#### A. Government Aided Business by Promiting Economic Development
How

#### B. Government Kept Regulations And Restrain On Business To A Minimum

The late nineteenth century is often characterized as an era of minimal national government intervention is tghe economy and society. Laissez-faire is the name often given to the policy that the national government should take a hand-off approach to economic and social problems.

Why was the case? Consider the following two factors:
+ Citizens expected very little of the national government. Consequently, the national government had yet to assume many of the responsibilities we take for granted today. For example: national government regulation of the environment, the workplace, the food and drug supply, and the national government’s responsibility for the welfare of groups such as the poor and elderly would not be established until the twentieth century.
So what did the national government do in the late nineteenth century?
Not much more than deliver mail, collect taxes (but not the income tax since it didn’t exist until the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913), fight Native Americans, guard the coasts, and preserve order.
The number of national government employees in 1871 was about 50,000. Today it is over 2.5 million.

+ An idea called Social Darwinism led many Americans to believe that government interference in the processes of social and economic change was a serious mistake.

**Ideas matter in history**. Study Tindall’s explanation of **Social Darwinism** on pages 710 - 712. Be sure you know why Social Darwinism was significant.


There is an important exception to the broad generalization that the late nineteenth century was an era of laissez-faire, or non-intervention by the national government.
In 1887, Congress created the **Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)**.
The ICC was the first independent federal (meaning national government) regulatory commission. Today, there are dozens of these regulatory commissions, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Labor Relations Board.
The ICC was an attempt by Congress to impose national government restraints on the private power of the railroads. Farmers had demanded that the national government protect them from unfair pricing and other practices by the railroads.

#### Conclusion
Please think about the following questions:
1\. What’s significant about the national government keeping regulations and restraints on business to a minimum during the late nineteenth century?
2\. How did the hands-off position of the national government shape the course of the industrial revolution?
