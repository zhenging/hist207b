### 16 The Era of Reconstruction 1865-1877

#### Reconstruction issues still around today:

**Birthright Citizenship** (Only the US and Canada have it)
14th Amendment (1868)

**Voting Rights**
15th Amendment (1870)

#### What were the results of the Civil War?

##### 1. Secession was dead.
+ Secession by Law (11 states left)

What would lincoln do?
> Waging war of the 11 states
War's Result: Total Defeat of the South
Lesson: If the state tries to leave, it will be destoried.

Keep those states in the union

##### 2. Slavery wad dead.
Ending slavery is not the original war objective.
1. Millitary Necessity
2. Foreign Policy Necessity
3. Right Thing To Do

When did Linconln end slavery?
>**Emancipation Proclamation** - was an executive order issued by Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863.

##### 3. 750,000 soldiers were dead.
+ Evidence Sheet 1 - This Repulic of Suffering
+ Total Population (North and South): 31 millions. (1/40 dead)
+ Casuality Ration: 70x of Vietnam War

Was it worth it?
>Today's equivalent = 6 millons

#### The word "reconstruction" refers to
+ The period **1865-1877**
+ The key issue of the period: readmitting the southern states into the Union

[Jefferson Davis' Farewell](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Jefferson_Davis_Farewell.htm) - Senator Jefferson Davis (Mississippi), Address to the Senate, Jan. 21, 1861
+ By April 1861, 11 states seceded.
+ Empty seats in Senate: 22-1 = 21.
+ Who stayed? Andrew J (1865-1869). He is loyal to Union. (P. 586)

How will we know when the South are readmitted?
> Empty seats are filled.

#### Key political questions the nation faced during reconstruction
+ What changes would the North impose on the South as a condition of readmission to the Union?
+ How would the status and rights of the former confederate be balanced against the status and rights of the former slaves?
+ What did the freed slaves seek beyond freedom?

#### The national's dilemma during reconstruction
+ Promote the reconciliation of the North and South
Andrew J
Race Hatred
**Or**
+ Provide the freed slaves "more (vote, legal equality, land)" than just free dom
Thaddeus Stevens, Radical Repulican

#### Sidebar
Do the southern states want their seats in congress back?
> Seats = Power.
Reunion means filling empty seats

#### J's Progam (J's terms of reunion)
**A**. J granted generous amnesty, pardons and restituion of property to the former confederate leaders. _Why was this significant?_
+ 15,000 requested, 13,500 granted. (90%).
+ Give back political (vote, hold office) & economic (land) power back to  confederate leaders (Why need pardons? Traitors)
+ Freed slaves' view of J's program?

**B**. J opposed granting the right to the African-Americans. _Why was this significant?_
+ No blacks vote under J's program.
+ Lots of elections were coming up in the South.
+ Political power up for grabs
+ Black excluded.

**C**. J states that the southern states would have to do the following to be readmitted: ratify the 13th Amendment (No More Slavery), nullify secession, and cancel their confederate debt. _Why was this significant?_
+ Mississippi and Texas defied J's program on 13th Amendment. J still supported their readmission anyway.
+ Characterize J's Program: **Amazingly Lenient**

#### Why did J choose to promote the reconciliation of the North and South at the expense of doing "more" for the freed slaves?
**A**. J was commited to the doctrine of states' rights
+ Study carefully #2 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet. (States' Rights)
  1\. Be able to define and give an example of states' rights. Know why the doctrine of states' rights was significant in the debate between J and the Republicans in Congress.
  2\. Know the argumetns J employed in defending states' rights and how the RRs attempted to counter those Arguments.
+ Key state right issue: Would freed slaves vote?
+ RRs: Yes. Called On J to force black voting in the South.
+ J: It's each state's right to decide. President can't interfere
+ RRs: Teh South gave up their states' rights.
+ J: They never left and still have their rights. There is no such thing as Reconstruction.

**B**. J's views on Race
+ Study carefully #3 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet.Be able to characterize J's views on Race and explain how his views on race shaped his program of reconstruction.
+ Study carefully #4 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet. Know what Bowen says about J's views on race.
+ splcenter.org
+ Racists (J commited to white surpremacy)
+ Group People
+ Brand blacks as inferior
+ J's brand of racisim: All blakcks are inferior, innate, inborn, permanent.

#### Congress' Program (Congress's terms of reunion)
Seats were still empty.
**A**. Joint committee on Reconstruction
+ Poluated by RRs
+ Run Congress' Program

**B**. 1866 Laws (14th Amendment) (P. 588)
+ Civil Rights Act: All blacks are citizens. Everybody has equal protection under law.
+ Put in 14th Amendment
+ Money for Freed men's Bureau. They were building schools for freed slaves' kids.
+ J's response? Veto why? Race hatred, states' rights. (States Rights Trace)
+ Congress' reponse to veto? Override veto: need 2/3 in house + 2/3 in the Senate.
+ Did republicans have that many votes? Yes/
  + Veto not working
  + J turns to obstruction. (did not implement laws that were passed).
  + Congress responded by impeaching and removing
+ Why did they come up 1 vote short in trial?

#### Radical Republicans (RRs)
- Subset of republican party
- They believe in equality of the races
- Do more for freed slaves

RRs' motives? SQ #5. (P 583, 587, 588)

#### Failure of J's Program


#### Evaluating J's leadership
+ J had historical opportunity to advance racial justice.
+ Kept nation on course of race hatred. (No significant until 1950's, about 100 years)
+ J's legacy: A century of crushing racial opppression and terrorism.
+ Really awful president. (Ranking of J's presidency: 42/43)
