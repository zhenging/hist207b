### Industrial Transformation issues still around today:
+ The industrial Revolution was built on fossil fuels and **mechanization**.
+ Ultimate manifestation of mechanization = **Machine Learning** (Algorithms) and **Robots**

Want a job? **"Employee Selection Program"**

Want to keep your job? **"Robots are coming for your jobs"**

Industrial Revolution Changed Everything

### 1. Work
Industrial Revolution = New System of Production

**Mass Production**: The repetitive production of a standard item by machine.

**Frederick Taylor**: The father of Scientific Management (Tindall p787-788)

>ES1. Frederick Winslow Taylor, “The Principles of Scientific Management,” 1911.
“In the past, the man had been first. In the future, the system must be first.”

The System Promotes **Effiency**.
**Taylor's goal**: Increase effiency and productivity of workers
**How?**
+ Time and motion studies
+ Taylor restructured work

**Core of Taylorism**: Subdivide work into smallest components
> Example: pre-industrial shoe-making

**Skilled Workers' Object**
+ Devaluation
+ Power shift from workers to Management
+ Alienation

>ES2. Robert Kanigel, The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Viking, 1977) From the dust cover of the book:

Obsessive/compulsive
Some industrial pushing back on Taylorism

>ES3. Conclusion to the industrial transformation of work

### 2. Agriculture
Industrial Revolution = mechanization of Agriculture
> Example: Combine (cutting and threshing)

Massive increase in Productivity
Price Collapse
Bankruptcy
Anger and Vulnerability

>ES4. Conclusion to the industrial transformation of agriculture: Tindall, previous edition
