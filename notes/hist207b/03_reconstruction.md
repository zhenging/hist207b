### 03 Reconstruction

#### Reconstruction issues still around today:

**Birthright Citizenship** (Only the US and Canada have it)
14th Amendment (1868)

**Voting Rights**
15th Amendment (1870)

#### What were the results of the Civil War?

##### 1. Secession was dead.
+ Secession by Law (11 states left)

What would lincoln do?
> Waging war of the 11 states
War's Result: Total Defeat of the South
Lesson: If the state tries to leave, it will be destoried.

Keep those states in the union

##### 2. Slavery wad dead.
Ending slavery is not the original war objective.
1. Millitary Necessity
2. Foreign Policy Necessity
3. Right Thing To Do

When did Linconln end slavery?
>**Emancipation Proclamation** - was an executive order issued by Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863.

##### 3. 750,000 soldiers were dead.
+ Evidence Sheet 1 - This Repulic of Suffering
+ Total Population (North and South): 31 millions. (1/40 dead)
+ Casuality Ration: 70x of Vietnam War

Was it worth it?
>Today's equivalent = 6 millons

#### The word "reconstruction" refers to
+ The period **1865-1877**
+ The key issue of the period: readmitting the southern states into the Union

[Jefferson Davis' Farewell](https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Jefferson_Davis_Farewell.htm) - Senator Jefferson Davis (Mississippi), Address to the Senate, Jan. 21, 1861
+ By April 1861, 11 states seceded.
+ Empty seats in Senate: 22-1 = 21.
+ Who stayed? Andrew J (1865-1869). He is loyal to Union. (P. 586)

How will we know when the South are readmitted?
> Empty seats are filled.

#### Key political questions the nation faced during reconstruction
+ What changes would the North impose on the South as a condition of readmission to the Union?
+ How would the status and rights of the former confederate be balanced against the status and rights of the former slaves?
+ What did the freed slaves seek beyond freedom?

#### The national's dilemma during reconstruction
+ Promote the reconciliation of the North and South
Andrew J
Race Hatred
**Or**
+ Provide the freed slaves "more (vote, legal equality, land)" than just free dom
Thaddeus Stevens, Radical Repulican

#### Sidebar
Do the southern states want their seats in congress back?
> Seats = Power.
Reunion means filling empty seats

#### 1. J's Progam (J's terms of reunion)
**A**. J granted generous amnesty, pardons and restituion of property to the former confederate leaders. _Why was this significant?_
+ 15,000 requested, 13,500 granted. (90%).
+ Give back political (vote, hold office) & economic (land) power back to  confederate leaders (Why need pardons? Traitors)
+ Freed slaves' view of J's program?

**B**. J opposed granting the right to the African-Americans. _Why was this significant?_
+ No blacks vote under J's program.
+ Lots of elections were coming up in the South.
+ Political power up for grabs
+ Black excluded.

**C**. J states that the southern states would have to do the following to be readmitted: ratify the 13th Amendment (No More Slavery), nullify secession, and cancel their confederate debt. _Why was this significant?_
+ Mississippi and Texas defied J's program on 13th Amendment. J still supported their readmission anyway.
+ Characterize J's Program: **Amazingly Lenient**

#### 2. Why did J choose to promote the reconciliation of the North and South at the expense of doing "more" for the freed slaves?
**A**. J was commited to the doctrine of states' rights
Study carefully #2 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet. (States' Rights)
Be able to define and give an example of states' rights. Know why the doctrine of states' rights was significant in the debate between J and the Republicans in Congress.
Know the argumetns J employed in defending states' rights and how the RRs attempted to counter those Arguments.
+ Key state right issue: Would freed slaves vote?
+ RRs: Yes. Called On J to force black voting in the South.
+ J: It's each state's right to decide. President can't interfere
+ RRs: Teh South gave up their states' rights.
+ J: They never left and still have their rights. There is no such thing as Reconstruction.

**B**. J's views on Race
Study carefully #3 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet. Be able to characterize J's views on Race and explain how his views on race shaped his program of reconstruction.
Study carefully #4 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet. Know what Bowen says about J's views on race.
+ splcenter.org
+ Racists (J commited to white surpremacy)
+ Group People
+ Brand blacks as inferior
+ J's brand of racisim: All blakcks are inferior, innate, inborn, permanent.

#### 3. Failure of J's Program
- During last half of 1865
- Under J's terms of reunion: south elected and sent new members to congress to fill empty seats.
- White southerns' view of J's terms? "Amazingly lenient". It was too good to be true. South rushed to seal with J and get their seats back.
- _What happend?_ J called on congress to seat new south members.
- _What happend next?_ Turning point in story.
  Evidence Sheet #5: Tindal P.588
- _Why outrage?_ Text Study Guide -> Who did south elect? -> Alexander H. Stephens (VP of Confederate)
- Final Point: J came so close to tilling seats.

**J failed Reconstruction.**

#### 4. Evaluating J's leadership
+ J had historical opportunity to advance racial justice.
+ Kept nation on course of race hatred. (No significant until 1950's, about 100 years)
+ J's legacy: A century of crushing racial opppression and terrorism.
+ Really awful president. (Ranking of J's presidency: 42/43)

#### 5. Radical Republicans (RRs)
- Subset of republican party
- They believe in equality of the races
- Do more for freed slaves

##### RRs' motives? SQ #5. (P 583, 587, 588)
_Who are they?_ Charles Sumner(Senator of Massachusetts),Benjamin Wade(Senator of Ohio); Thaddeus Stevens (House Representative of Pennsylvania)
(1) Political motive: Blacks will vote republican (they are trying to help slaves).
(2) Humanitarian motive: Evidence? - Part of anti-slavery movement **Before** civil war
  - Stevens: In his will, he requested to be buried in integrated cemetry.

**Role of Religion**
  - Stevens is from Pennsylvania(Quaker state).
  - Quakers believe people are equal in God's eyes.
  - Sumner is from Massachusetts (Puritan state).
  - Puntans believe people are equal in God's eyes.

(3) Punishiment movtive:
  - Stevens said: The whole fabric of southern society must be changed.

Evidence Sheet #6: Good example to put in essay.


#### 6. Congress' Program (Congress's terms of reunion)

+ Civil Rights Act: All blacks are citizens. Everybody has equal protection under law.
+ Put in 14th Amendment
+ Money for Freed men's Bureau. They were building schools for freed slaves' kids.
+ J's response? Veto why? Race hatred, states' rights. (States Rights Trace)
+ Congress' response to veto? Override veto: need 2/3 in house + 2/3 in the Senate.
+ Did republicans have that many votes? Yes
  + Veto not working
  + J turns to obstruction. (did not implement laws that were passed).

  + Former confederate leaders were excluded from office and voting

#### 7. Go to Blacks in Congress handout
Why did African Americans flip? (From Republican to Democratic)
+ Party loyalties were forged in civil war. (Lasted for about 100 years)
+ Black in South = Republican
+ White in South = Democratic
