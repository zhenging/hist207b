Outline p.2. **Study**
Outline p.3. **Bio of Herbert Hoover**

**Main Themes**
+ Republicans placed government in the service of business.

**William E. Leuchtenburg, The Perils of Prosperity, 1914 – 1932, (University of Chicago Press, 1993)**
Even before Coolidge took office, the Republican party had become firmly committed to singleinterest government. By allying the government with business, the Republicans believed that they were benefiting the entire nation... The 1920's represent ...a hierarchical conception of society with a deliberate pursuit by the government of policies most favorable to large business interests. No political party, no national administration, could conceivably have been more co-operative with corporate interests... If, as Republican orators promised, this alliance succeeded in maintaining prosperity, the wisdom of single-interest politics would be demonstrable. If it failed, a sharp reaction against single-interest politics would be inevitable. This, in essence, became the central question in the politics of the 1920's: whether the business interest, given full support by a cooperative government, could maintain prosperity and develop social policies which would redound to the benefit not merely of itself but of the whole nation.
+ Republicans redirected government intervention away from progressive reform and toward serving business.
+ Republicans attempted to roll back **the public service concept of the state**, which we have defined as the belief that government should be active and seek to solve social and economic problems. Be sure you have memorized this definition of the public service concept of the state.

**Even though Republicans tried to resist them, these fundamental and powerful forces continued to drive the government to expand its role in society and the economy:**
+ Industrialism and urbanization—and technological change generally—made society and the economy increasingly interdependent. Citizens increasingly depended on corporations.
+ Citizens turned to government to manage interdependence and to protect citizens from powerful economic interests.
+ Private groups of citizens (interest groups) demanded government help in advancing their goals.

**Let's look at Herbert Hoover: Major 1920s figure**

+ "The Tragedy of The Great Engineer"
+ Hoover was Tagged as "Do-nothing president". Down to Defeat
+ "American Individualism" by Hoover.

**Hoover's credentials as a progressive, Tindall, previous edition**
Forgotten in the rush of later events would be Hoover's credentials as a progressive, humanitarian president. Over the objection of Treasury Secretary Mellon, he announced a plan for tax reductions in the low-income brackets. He refused to interfere with peaceful picketing of the White House. He also defended his wife's right to invite prominent blacks to the White House, and he sought more money for all-black Howard University.

**More on Hoover's credentials as a progressive**
In 1909 he published Principles of Mining, a manual for engineers and managers that advocated collective bargaining, the eight-hour work day, and serious attention to mine safety. The book became a standard text in mining schools and helped spread Hoover's reputation as an unusually progressive, enlightened businessman.

#### A. Hoover's Beliefs: Proper Role of Government
**DEFINITION OF VOLUNTARISM:**
Voluntarism is the name given to a set of beliefs held by Hoover (and others) regarding the role that government should play in the economy and society. Hoover believed that social and economic problems are best resolved by the voluntary and cooperative actions of citizens. Government solutions should be imposed only as a last resort. Hoover believed that Americans could solve social and economic problems without ever-expanding government intervention because of the citizens' willingness to step forward voluntarily to serve their communities and nation. Please know these key components of voluntarism.

**Hoover feared direct national government intervention:**
+ Would undermine individual initiative.
+ Would make citizens dependent on government.

**Republicans**: Deeply skeptical of government intervention.
**Democrats**: Government Intervention can improve society.

**Hoover's "governing philosophy," Tindall, p.916**
Hoover feared that the nation would be "plunged into socialism" if the government provided direct support to the poor. His governing philosophy, rooted in America's mythic commitment to rugged individualism and free enterprise, set firm limits on emergency government actions. The president still trumpeted the virtues of "self-reliance" and individual initiative, claiming that government assistance would rob people of the desire to help themselves.

**Sum it up:**
+ Less Government Intervention
+ Is Voluntarism Still around today?

#### B. Hoover's Actions
**Meetings at White House, Tindall, p.914 - 915**
He invited business, labor, government, and agricultural leaders to a series of White House conferences in which he urged companies to maintain employment and wage levels, asked union leaders to end strikes, and pleaded with state governors to accelerate planned construction projects so as to keep people working."

**Tindall, p.914 - 916**
Hoover "did more than any previous president in addressing such calamitous economic circumstances..."

### 3. Reconstruction Finance Corp. RFC Jan. 1932
New national government agency
**Mission**: Shore Up Financial System

Public $$$$$$ ... Given to ... Private Banks and RRs
Called "Loans"

BUT: Nothing in RFC for unemployed
Hoover insisted: welfare dependency.
Why?

Opponents Criticized Hoover for double standard

**Robert Wagner, Senator, NY, Dem**
"We shall help the railroad; we shall help the financial institutions; and I agree that we should. But is there any reason why we should not likewise extend a helping hand to the forlorn American, in every village and every city of the United States, who has been without wages since 1929? Must
he alone carry the cross of individual responsibility?"

**Choices Hoover might have made, Tindall, previous edition**
By 1932, members of Congress were introducing bills to provide federal relief directly to distressed people.
At that point, Hoover might have pleaded "dire necessity," taken the leadership of the relief movement, and salvaged his political fortunes.

**Hoover's rigidity, Tindall, previous edition**
But Hoover's own philosophy—Voluntarism—now hardened into dogma, set strict limits on action by the federal government, and he refused to set his philosophy aside even to meet the unprecedented emergency.
