## OUTLINE:  CIVIL RIGHTS

### Introduction
What systems of law has the South employed to maintain the racial hierarchy?

In the 1950s and 1960s unprecedented efforts were mounted to revolutionize the nation's system of race relations and secure unabridged civil and political rights for African-Americansand other minorities.

Historians call this battle the "Second Reconstruction.""

One of our objectivesis to critically examine the leadership (or lack thereof) on civil rights by presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson.

Pay particular attention to the passages in your text where Tindall assesses presidential leadership on civil rights.

Eisenhower: pp. 1052 â€“1053

Kennedy:  pp. 1081

Johnson:  pp. 1099 -1100
