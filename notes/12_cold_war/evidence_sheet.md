### EVIDENCE SHEET:THE COLD WAR1

#### ES1. Thomas G. Paterson, Meeting the Communist Threat, Truman to Reagan(Oxford University Press, 1988)
Americans have been anti-Communist because they perceive Communism as truly threatening and alien. It is obvious that Communism contrasts sharply with American ideology and experience. Americanscelebrate private ownership of property, private property, individual initiative, and the free marketplace of capitalism.They value their bill of rights, especially their First Amendment freedoms of speech and religion, and their political system of representative democracy and constitutionalism. The United States record has been blemished, of course, as Communists frequently remind sometimes embarrassed Americans, for practice has often violated the ideal.

Still, Americans proudly, even arrogantly proclaim their economic and political liberties and invite people of other nations to match them. Americans believe that Communism denies these liberties and subordinates people to a suffocating, state-dictated regimen that stifles initiative, stunts economic growth, and perpetuates the power of self-serving dictatorial rulers. Americans have also been anti-Communist becausethey recoil from the Communist call for world revolution and protest Soviet support of revolutions in the Third World. This is quite understandable, because Americans have seen most revolutions as challenges to their vaunted position as the "haves." Finally, American anti-Communism has been intensified by the dismal history of Communist governments and the cruelties they have visited upon their people—witness Josef Stalin's purges, Fidel Castro's political repression, or Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution.

#### ES2. Telegram: Churchill to Truman, May 12, 1945
What is to happen about Europe? An iron curtain is drawn down upon [the Russian] front. We do not know what is going on behind it... Surely it is vital now to come to an understanding with Russia, or see where we are with her, before we weaken our armies mortally.

#### ES3. Josef Stalin, April, 1945, as quoted in Milovan Djilas, Conversations with Stalin(Harcourt, 1962)
"This war is not as in the past; whoever occupies a territory also imposes on it his own social system. Everyone imposes his own system as far as his army can reach. It cannot be otherwise."

#### ES4. Tindall, p. 982 –983 and previous ed., on who lost Eastern Europe to communism
Critics, mostly Republicans,later attacked Roosevelt for "giving" Eastern Europe over to Soviet domination at Yalta. But the course of the war shaped the actions at Yalta, not Roosevelt's diplomacy. The United States had no real leverage to exert in the region. As a U.S. diplomat admitted, "Stalin heldall the cards" at Yalta. The American and British could not have done anything to alter these facts. Allied forces in Europe would have been hopelessly outmanned and outgunned by the Red Army.

#### ES5. Melvyn P. Leffler, A Preponderance of Power: National Security, the Truman Administration, and the Cold War(Stanford University Press, 1992)
Truman administration officials were willing to accept a rupture in the Soviet-U.S. relationship because they were convinced that the dangers of inaction greatly exceeded the risks that inhered in provoking the Soviets. Simply stated, the cold war and the division of Europe were regrettable prospects but not nearly so ominous as the dangers that would result from Communist gains and the prospective erosion of U.S. influence throughout the industrial core of western Europe...

The calculated risk-taking of the prudent men who occupied the highest offices in the Truman administration turned out to be a great success.

#### ES6. X, "The Sources of Soviet Conduct," Foreign Affairs25 (July 1947)
"It will be clearly seen that the Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the Western world is something that can be contained by the adroit and vigilant application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points, corresponding to the shifts and maneuvers of Soviet policy, but which cannot be charmed or talked out of existence. The Russians look forward to a duel of infinite duration, and they see that they have scored great successes."

#### ES7. Harry S. Truman, Speech to the Congress, March 12, 1947
"The peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will. The Government of the United States has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidation, in violation of the Yalta agreement, in Poland, Rumania, and Bulgaria. I must also state that in a number of other countries there have been similar developments.

At the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life. The choice is too often not a free one.

One way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression.

The second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority. It relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms.I believe it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."

#### ES8. Melvyn P. Leffler, A Preponderance of Power: National Security, the Truman Administration, and the Cold War(Stanford University Press, 1992)
In understanding the nature of the Soviet threat in the early postwar years, in grasping the economic foundations of geopolitical success(means that the power vacuum must be filled with US institutions)... Truman administration officials manifested sagacity, sensitivity, and wisdom(means that they got it right). Of course, none of this would have been possible if the United States did not have the wealth and power to offer economic aid(that's the Marshall Plan, MP)and strategic guarantees(that's NATO)to the nations of Western Europe. Money(MP)and security(NATO)were of decisive importance to governments and peoples in Western Europe who were wavering(contingency here)in 1946 –1947 between alternative strategies of development(means communism vs. democracy).

#### ES9. Tindall, p. 1022 and previous ed., on who lost China to communism
Truman's critics—mostly Republicans—now asked bitterly, "Who lost China?" But it is hard to imagine how the U.S.government could have prevented a Communist victory short of getting involved in a massive military intervention, which would have been risky, unpopular, and expensive.
