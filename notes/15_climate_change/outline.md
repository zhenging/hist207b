### Introduction
Fossil Fuel
+ Ancient Dead Plant -> Heat Pressure + No Oxygen -> Oil and Coal
+ Millions of Years
+ Heat Trapping Gases (Burning Fossil Fuel)

1896: Linked CO2 to Rising Temperature.
First warning to the President (LBJ) in 1965.

**Meet James Hansan (PHD Physics)**
+ 1988: Hansan testimony in Senate
+ Global warming policy debated on 1988.

### 1. UN Response (IPCC, 1988)
**IPCC** - Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change

**Sum up:**
+ Warming unprecedented
+ Over last 800,000 years
+ Cause: Human burning Fossil Fuel

**Temperature rises so far**
+ 1880s to today: $1^{\degree}$C ($1.7^{\degree}$F)
+ Paris Agreement in 2016
  + Target: $2^{\degree}$C Max
  + Current Pledge: $3.5^{\degree}$C

**Every degree matters.**

**Last global ice age**
+ 100,000-150,000 years ago
+ Average temperature only $5^{\degree}$C cooler than today.
+ Sea level: 330 feet lower.

**Every fraction of degree matters.**
+ $1.5^{\degree}$C = 70%-90% coral gone.
+ $2.0^{\degree}$C = 99% coral gone.

800,000 years - Ice core
+ More CO2 = Higher Temperature
+ Less CO2 = Lower Temperature

**Where are we headed?**
+ Depends.
+ Problem: Growth Mindset (Economoy)

**What will $2^{\degree}$C look like?**
+ Extrem Weather
+ Coast Flooded
+ Refugee Crisis
+ Disease Spreaded
+ Food Supply Shortage
+ Infrastructure Endangered
+ Human behavior Affected

**To Hold $1.5^{\degree}$C rise**
+ By 2030, global CO2 emission must fall by 45%.
+ By 2050, net zero CO2 emission.

**Obstacle to CO2 Cut**
+ Human footprint
+ China and India (Racing for Economy Development & Wealth)
+ Over 50% of total CO2 emission estimated last 30 years.
+ 85% since WWII.

### 2. Climate Change Deniers
Exxon Story.
Trump: The Road Not Taken

### 3. Why do People Deny?
+ **A. Self-interest**
  + 80% Fossil Fuel reserves must stay in Ground = 20 trillion write off, Minimum.
  + Immense Economic Disruption.
+ **B. Political Ideology**. Government will never be enpowered on a wartime scale. (Trust in government collapsed.)
+ **C. Anti-Science Mindset**. Skeptics well organized.

**What can do do?**
+ Organize -> Magnifying Power.
