Women’s success in gaining access to the ballot also did not turn out as had been predicted, either by advocates or by opponents. The right of women to vote should have required no special justification, but to overcome resistance to approval of the Nineteenth Amendment suffragists, accepting the traditional view of woman's nature, had argued that giving women the ballot would purify politics and initiate a new era of universal peace and benevolence. On the other hand, foes had forecast the disintegration of American society. As it turned out, the Nineteenth Amendment had few immediate consequences, for good or evil.
Both friends and enemies of women's suffrage had anticipated that when the amendment was ratified women would seize upon the opportunity and would vote as a bloc. Politicians, fearful of how such developments might affect their survival, initially responded by heeding the desires of women for legislation such as the Sheppard-Towner act, authorizing federal funding of health care for mothers and infants. But it quickly became apparent that women, in common with other newly enfranchised groups, did not vote in the same proportion as men. Asked why they did not vote, numbers of women replied, to the dismay of those who had labored so long to end discrimination at the polls, either that they did not believe in suffrage for women or that they had neglected to do so because their husbands had forgotten to remind them. Nor did women who did vote do so as a female bloc. Wives voted the same way that their husbands did. Once politicians realized that women did not vote as a bloc, they stopped catering to their demands. In 1929, the Sheppard-Towner Act was allowed to lapse. Furthermore, women who did want to mobilize their sex found it hard to define what a "woman's issue" was. Achieving suffrage had the ironic consequence of removing the one cause around which most women could rally. Even the SheppardTowner act reflected the traditional role perception of woman as mother. Expected to be a progressive force, women in 1920 had instead bolstered the status quo by swelling Warren Harding’s victory margin, because well-to-do women were more likely to vote and the wealthier classes were preponderantly Republican.
Still, significant changes were taking place. Millions of women did vote for the first time, a right too long denied them, and some women were elected to public office (several had gained seats in Congress by the end of the 1920s). As governor of New York, Al Smith depended on the counsel of Belle Moskowitz, and women such as Eleanor Roosevelt were gaining the political experience that would be indispensable in later years. Furthermore, newly enfranchised women provided an invaluable leaven to community activities throughout the land.

Suffragists were not the only reformers ever to fall short of their own expectations. Other electoral reforms of the progressive era, such as the referendum, the recal, and direct primaries, historian William E. Chafe points out, also had little impact. Despite progressive efforts to democratize the electoral process, voter turnout in the 1920s fell; only about half of eligible voters participated in presidential elections in the 1920s, for instance, compared to 80 percent in the late nineteenth century. Women alone could not be blamed for the decline, recent studies suggest, for male voter participation dropped as well. Jane Addams made this point at the time: When asked in 1924 by the Woman Citizen, “Is woman suffrage failing?” she replied that the question should be “Is suffrage failing?” Still, women took the blame. By the mid-1920s, articles proclaiming the “failure” of woman suffrage, and veterans of the suffrage movement analyzed what had gone wrong. Women were disappointed in politics, contended Carrie Chapman Catt in 1923, “because they miss the exaltation, the thrill of expectancy, the vision which stimulated them in the suffrage campaign... They find none of these appeals to their aspirations in the party of their choice.” Emily Blair, in 1931, found even deeper cause for activists’ disappointment. Feminism, said Blair, “expressed the desire of women once more to have a part in the making of the world. But it did not work out that way. The best men continued to win, and women, even the best, worked for and under him. Women were welcome to come in as workers but not as co-makers of the world. For all their numbers, they seldom rose to positions of responsibility or power. The few who did fitted into the system as they found it. All standards, all methods, all values, continued to be set by men.”

“The action of President Roosevelt in entertaining that nigger will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they will learn their place again.”

#### ES4. Edmund Morris on Theodore Roosevelt’s views on race, “The Most Damnable Outrage,” p. 53
A black man who advanced faster than his fellows should be rewarded with every privilege that democracy could bestow. For those blacks who did not, Roosevelt had little sympathy. The Georgian blood of his unreconstructed mother persuaded him that the Fifteenth Amendment had been “a mistake,” and that in nine cases out of ten, disfranchisement was justified. Blacks were better suited for service than suffrage; on the whole, they were “altogether inferior to the whites.”
Yet Roosevelt believed (as most Americans did not) that this inferiority was temporary. Negro advancement must “necessarily be painful”—witness the scars on Washington’s face, his air of swarthy suffering—but equality would come, as black Americans, generation by generation, acquired the civilized characteristics of whites.

#### ES5. Tindall on Woodrow Wilson’s views on race, previous edition
Like many other Progressives, Woodrow Wilson showed little interest in the plight of African Americans. In fact, he shared many of the racist attitudes prevalent at the time. Although Wilson never joined the Ku Klux Klan and he denounced its “reign of terror,” he sympathized with its motives of restoring white rule in the postwar South and relieving whites of the “ignorant and hostile” power of the black vote. Many of the southerners Wilson appointed to his cabinet were uncompromising racists who systematically segregated the employees in their agencies.

#### ES6. Equal Justice Initiative, Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror
Some “public spectacle lynchings” were attended by the entire white community and conducted as celebratory acts of racial control and domination. [And spiritual acts of purification] These lynchings were not “frontier justice,” because they generally took place in communities where there was a functioning criminal justice system that was deemed too good for African-Americans.”

#### ES7. Philip Dray, “A Negro’s Life is a Very Cheap Thing in Georgia,” pp. 7-8.
By definition, lynching denies a suspect due process under law, and so the kind of information that due process generates—lawyers’ arguments, a judge’s rulings, testimony, evidence—is not available to assist the historian in understanding the instigating deed. In the Hose case, there was no police investigation made of the crime scene, no evidence gathered, and Mattie Cranford was neither interviewed by any official or reporter nor examined by a physician.
