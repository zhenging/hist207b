Progressivism issues still around today: Political Participation

All citizens should vote. Here's why.
1\. Your vote counts.
George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election by 537 popular votes in Florida out of about 6 million votes cast in the state.

2\. Voting empowers you. Here's how it works.
+ When you vote, you put yourself in the electoral system.
+ You become part of the select group of citizens that pollesters and politicians care about and pay attention to.
+ Pollesters and politicians only care about and pay attention to voters - not to non-voters.

"“The progressive movement represented the common spirit of an age rather than a singleorganized group or party.

+ The **direct initiative** allows voters to originate and enact state laws. Prior to this progress reform, the power to make state laws belongs to each state's legislature. (**state law**)
+ The **recall** allows voters to remove from office elected state officials before the expiration of their term. Prior to this progressive reform, the power to remove elected state officials belonged to each state's legislature. (**state law**)
