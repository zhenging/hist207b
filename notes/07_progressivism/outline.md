**All citizens should vote. Here's why.**

2\. Voting empowers you. Here's how it works.
+ When you vote, you put yourself in the electoral system.
+ You become part of the select group of citizens that pollsters and politicians care about and pay attention to.
+ Pollsters and politicians only care about and pay attention to voters - not to non-voters.

### 1. The Features of Progressivism
(What Progressives Advocated)

#### A. Democratic Political Reform
Progressives believed that more democracy would:
+ Reduce corruption in the political progressive
+ Break up the coalition between government and business
+ Make government more responsive to citizens

Democratic political reforms would provide citizens with tools to restrain concentrated corporate power.

**Structural changes** progressives made to the political system include:
+ The **direct primary election** allows voters to choose which political parties will nominate. Prior to this progressive, the power to select policital party nominees belonged to party leaders and officeholders. (**state law**)
+ The **direct initiative** allows voters to originate and enact state laws. Prior to this progress reform, the power to make state laws belongs to each state's legislature. (**state law**)
+ The **recall** allows voters to remove from office elected state officials before the expiration of their term. Prior to this progressive reform, the power to remove elected state officials belonged to each state's legislature. (**state law**)
+ The **direct election of U.S. senators** (17th Amendment)
+ Women's suffrage (19th Amendment)

>**19th Amendment**
1\. No voting discrimination based on gender.
2\. Nullified states' right to decide) (changed the **Constitution**) (p.783-384, 845-846)

#### B. Government Regulation
Progressives wanted more government regulation.

**What is government regulation?**
+ Government regulation is the continuous monitoring by government departments and experts of the economic power concentrated in corporations. Progressives believed that government monitoring of corporations would occur on behalf of the citizens.

**What force were driving the government to expand its roles in society and the economy?**
+ Industrialism and urbanization-and technological change generally-made society and the economy increasingly **interdependent**. Citizens increasingly depended on corporations.
+ Citizens turned to government to manage interdependent and to protect citizens from powerful economic interests.
+ Private groups of citizens (interest group) demanded government help in advancing their goals.

During the period 1900-1920, progressives responded to these factors by increasing government intervention in the economy and society.
