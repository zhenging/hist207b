<p>Progressivism issues still around today: Political Participation</p>
<p>All citizens should vote. Here's why.<br />
1. Your vote counts.<br />
George W. Bush won the 2000 presidential election by 537 popular votes in Florida out of about 6 million votes cast in the state.</p>
<p>2. Voting empowers you. Here's how it works.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you vote, you put yourself in the electoral system.</li>
<li>You become part of the select group of citizens that pollesters and politicians care about and pay attention to.</li>
<li>Pollesters and politicians only care about and pay attention to voters - not to non-voters.</li>
</ul>

The Progressive Era saw major advancements in environmental conservation.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>What is Progressivism?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The name given to an era of reform: roughtly 1900-1917</li>
<li>A moment that transformed America's politics, economy, and society.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What were the catalysts behind progressive reforms?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What spurred progressive reformers to act, to seek change?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Problems stemming from industrialization, urbanization, and immigration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What was the general aim of Progressive movement?</strong><br />
From Tindall<br />
&quot;“The progressive movement represented the common spirit of an age rather than a singleorganized group or party. What reformers shared was a common assumption that the complex social ills and tensions generated by the urban-industrial revolution required expanding the scope of local, state, and federal government authority so as to elevate the public interest over private greed.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What social and economic problems did progressives try to fix?</strong></p>
<h3>1. The Features of Progressivism</h3>
<p>(What Progressives Advocated)</p>
<h4>A. Democratic Political Reform</h4>
<p>Progressives believed that more democracy would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce corruption in the political progressive</li>
<li>Break up the coalition between government and business</li>
<li>Make government more responsive to citizens</li>
</ul>
<p>Democratic political reforms would provide citizens with tools to restrain concentrated corporate power.</p>
<p><strong>Structural changes</strong> progressives made to the political system include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>direct primary election</strong> allows votes to choose which political parties will nominate. Prior to this progressive, the power to select policital party nominees belonged to party leaders and officeholders. (<strong>state law</strong>)</li>
<li>The <strong>direct initiative</strong> allows voters to originate and enact state laws. Prior to this progress reform, the power to make state laws belongs to each state's legislature. (<strong>state law</strong>)</li>
<li>The <strong>recall</strong> allows voters to remove from office elected state officials before the expiration of their term. Prior to this progressive reform, the power to remove elected state officials belonged to each state's legislature. (<strong>state law</strong>)</li>
<li>The <strong>direct election of U.S. senators</strong> (17th Amendment)</li>
<li>Women's suffrage (19th Amendment, No voting discrimination based on gender. Nullified states' right to decide) (changed the <strong>Constitution</strong>) (p783-384, 845-846)</li>
</ul>
<h4>B. Government Regulation</h4>
<p>Progressives wanted more government regulation.</p>
<p>What is government regulation?</p>
<ul>
<li>Government regulation is the continuous monitoring by government departments and experts of the economic power concentrated in corporations. Progressives believed that government monitoring of corporations would occure on behalf of the citizens.</li>
</ul>
<p>What force were driving the government to expand its rols in society and the economy?</p>
<ul>
<li>Industrialism and urbanization-and technological change generally-made society and the economy increasingly <strong>interdependent</strong>. Citizens increasingly depended on corporations.</li>
<li>Citizens turned to government to manage interdependent and to protect citizens from powerful economic interests.</li>
<li>Private groups of citizens (interest group) demanded government help in advancing their goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the period 1900-1920, progressives responded to these factors by increasing government intervention in the economy and society.</p>
<p>What happened during the Progressive era that convinced many citizens that more government regulation was needed?</p>
<ul>
<li>Read about conditions in the meatpacking plants and take notes here. (p.796-798)</li>
<li>Read about child labor and take notes here. (p.791-792)</li>
<li>Read about the Triangle Shirtwaist and take notes here. (p.792)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion: The Legacy of Progressivism</h3>
<ul>
<li>Think of the Progressivism era as two decades of increasing government intervention in the economy and society.</li>
<li>By 1920, 19th century notions of strictly limited government intervention (&quot;laissez-faire&quot;) has been eclipsed.</li>
<li>Progressives helped established <strong>the public service concept of the state</strong>: the belief that government should be active and seek to solve social and economic problems.</li>
<li>Be sure to memorized this definition of the public service concept of the state.</li>
