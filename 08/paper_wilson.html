<strong>Support your essay by incorporating specific information and examples from the sources available to you: your class notes, the article Crusader for a Better World, the League of Nations doc (including Lodge's Speech), the Article X doc, the World War I evidence sheet, and your text.</strong></p>
<p>1. Identify and explain how the political process in the Senate made it difficult for Wilson to secure U.S. participation in the League of Nations. Be sure to explain the role of Henry Cabot Lodge.</p>
<p>2. Describe and explain the League of Nations. Why did critics of the Treaty object to US membership in the League? Cite specific objections raised by Lodge in his speech to the Senate.</p>
<p>3. Conclusion: In the area of foreign policy, what credit and what criticism does Wilson deserve? An outline of our conclusion is at the end of your evidence sheet.</p>
<h4>Political Process</h4>
<p>Part I of the Treaty of Versailles created the Convenant of the New League of Nations. For U.S to participate in the League of Nations, the treaty had to be approved by the Senate with super majority (two thirds). On July 8, 1919, Wilson arrived back in Washington, D.C, to begin working for approval of the treaty by the Senator, where the Republicans outnumbered the Democrats. Wilson submitted the treaty in July 10, 1919 and called for another appearance in the Senate.<br />
The treaty then went to the Senate Foreign Relation Committee (SFRC), whoes chair was Henry Lodge. At the time the treaty was submitted, Wilson was becoming the most powerfule and popular man in the world. To gain a level play field, Lodge's strategy was to stall approval of the treaty in hopes that public opposition would grow. He took six weeks simply reading about the lengthy text to his SFRC. He then organized a parade of expert witnesses, most of them oppose to the treaty, to appear at the hearings on ratification. Crtics get a platform and there are 60 witnesses. To further delay the process, Lodge proposed 14 points reservations, an act to mock Wilson's 14 points.</p>
<h4>The League of Nations</h4>
<p>The League fo Nations was an intergovernmental organization founded as a result of the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First World War. It was the first international organzation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. Its primary goals, as stated in its Convenant, included prventing wars through collective security and disarmament, and setting international disputed through negotiation and arbitration. At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members.<br />
The League lacked its own armed force and depended on the Great Powers to enforce its resultions, keep to its economic sanction, or provide an army when needed. However, the Great Powers were often relucant to do so.<br />
While Wilson fully committed to the League of Nations, Lodge argued that America should maintain maxium freedom of action by not participating in the League of Nations. In his speech to the Senate, Lodge stated, &quot;The real essence of that doctrine is that American questions shall be settled by Americans alone; that the Americans shall be separated from Europe and from the interference of Europe i purely American questions.&quot; Another argument Lodged made was that Americans should be ware of binding committments in peacetime according to the Convenant term, &quot;Any war or threat of war, whether immediately affecting any of the Members of the League or not, is hereby declared a mattter of concern to the whole League.&quot;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Many historians credit Wilson for doing more than anyone to establish the first association of nations and establishing the goals and objectives of US foreign policies in the 20th century. Some historians critize Wilson based on this sequence of event</p>
