<h4>Political Process</h4>
<p>Part I of the Treaty of Versailles created the Convenant of the New League of Nations. For U.S to participate in the League of Nations, the treaty had to be approved by the Senate. On July 8, 1919, Wilson arrived back in Washington, D.C, to begin working for approval of the treaty by the Senator, where the Republicans outnumbered the Democrats. Wilson submitted the treaty in July 10, 1919 and called for another appearance in the Senate.</p>
