<h4>Workers Contest the Meaning of Freedom</h4>
<p>James McPherson, The Battle Cry of Freedom (Oxford University Press, 1988), pp. 23-24</p>
<p>It was not so much the level of wages as the very concept of wages itself that fueled much [labor] protest. Wage labor was a form of dependency that seemed to contradict the republican principles on which the country had been founded. The core of republicanism was liberty, a precious but precarious birthright constantly threatened by corrupt manipulations of power. The philosopher of republicanism, Thomas Jefferson, had defined the essence of liberty as independence, which required the ownership of productive property. A man dependent on others for a living could never be truly free, nor could a dependent class constitute the basis of a republican government. Women, children, and slaves were dependent; that defined them out of the polity of republican freemen. Wage laborers were also dependent; that was why Jefferson feared the development of industrial capitalism with its need for wage laborers. Jefferson envisaged an ideal America of farmers and artisan producers who owned their means of production and depended on no man for a living.</p>
<p>But the American economy did not develop that way. Instead, skilled craftsmen who owned their tools and sold the products of their labor for a &quot;just price&quot; found themselves gradually drawn into a relationship where they sold their labor. Instead of working for themselves, they worked for someone else. Instead of earning a just price for their skill, they earned wages whose amount was determined not by the intrinsic value of their labor but by what an increasingly distant &quot;market&quot; would bear. No longer were &quot;master&quot; and &quot;journeyman&quot; bound together by the commonality of their trade and by the journeyman's expectation of becoming a master himself. More and more they were separated into &quot;employer&quot; and &quot;employee,&quot; with different and sometimes conflicting interests. The employer wanted to maximize profits, which meant improving the efficiency and controlling the costs of production, including wages. The employee became dependent on the &quot;boss&quot; not only for wages but also for the means of production—machines that the worker himself could no longer hope to own. The emergence of industrial capitalism . . . thus began to forge a new system of class relations between capitalists who owned the means of production and workers who owned only their labor power. Journeymen artisans who experienced this process did not like it. They and their spokesmen offered a sharp critique of emerging capitalism.</p>
<p>Capitalism was incompatible with republicanism, they insisted. Dependence on wages robbed a man of his independence and therefore of his liberty. Wage labor was no better than slave labor—hence &quot;wage slavery.&quot; The boss was like a slave-owner. He determined the hours of toil, the pace of work, the division of labor, the level of wages; he could hire and fire at will. The pre-industrial artisan had been accustomed to laboring as much or as little as he pleased. He worked by the job, not by the clock. If he felt like taking time off for a drink or two with friends, he did so. But in the new regimen all laborers worked in lockstep; the system turned them into machines; they became slaves to the clock. Manufacturers encouraged the temperance movement that gathered force after 1830 because its Protestant ethic virtues of sobriety, punctuality, reliability, and thrift were precisely the values needed by disciplined workers in the new order. Some employers banned drinking on the job and tried even to forbid their workers to drink off the job. For men who considered their thrice-daily tipple a right, this was another mark of slavery.</p>
