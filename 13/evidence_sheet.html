<h4>ES1. Tindall on the role of churches in the civil rights movement, previous edition</h4>
<p>The African-American leaders of the civil rights movement were animated by powerful religious beliefs. Ministers were in the vanguard of the movement for racial equality and social justice... African-American congregations were the seedbed for civil rights protests and volunteers.</p>
<h4>ES2. Tindall on Jackie Robinson, previous edition</h4>
<p>Jackie Robinson vividly demonstrated that racism, not inferiority, impeded African-American advancement in the postwar era and that segregation need not be a permanent condition of American life.</p>
<h4>ES3. Tindall, on grassroots activists, p. 1053 and previous edition</h4>
<p>The most important leadership related to the civil rights movement came not from government officials but from the long-suffering people whose rights were most suppressed: African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and other minorities.</p>
<h4>ES4. Earl Warren, June 1943.</h4>
<p>Quoted in David Halberstam, The Fifties(Random House, 1993) &quot;If the Japs are released, no one will be able to tell a saboteur from any other Jap... We don't want to have a second Pearl Harbor in California. We don't propose to have the Japs back in California during this war if there is any lawful means of preventing it.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES5. Plessy v. Ferguson, 1896:</h4>
<p>Laws requiring the separation of the races &quot;do not necessarily imply the inferiority of either race to the other...&quot; The enforced separation of the races does not stamp &quot;the colored race with a badge of inferiority.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES6. Brown v. Board of Education, 1954:</h4>
<p>&quot;To separate [schoolchildren] . . . solely on the basis of race generates a feeling of inferiority as totheir status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone... Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES7. Dwight D. Eisenhower, Press Conference, May 19, 1954</h4>
<p>&quot;I think it makes no difference whether or not I endorse it. The Constitution is as the Supreme Court interprets it; and I must conform to that and do my very best to see that it is carried out in this country.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES8. Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1956</h4>
<p>Quoted in Emmet John Hughes, The Ordeal of Power: A Political Memoir of theEisenhower Years(Atheneum, 1963)&quot;I am convinced that the Supreme Court decision set backprogress in the South at least fifteenyears...It's all very well to talk about school integration—if you remember you may also be talking about social disintegration. Feelings are deep on this, especially where children are involved... We can't demand perfection in these moral questions.All we can do is keep working toward a goal and keep it high. And the fellow who tries to tell me you can do these things by forceis just plain nuts.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES9. Dwight D. Eisenhower, October 10, 1956</h4>
<p>Quoted in E. Frederick Morrow, Black Man in the White House: A Diary of theEisenhower Years by the Administrative Officer for Special Projects, the White House, 1955 –1961,(Coward-McCann, 1963)&quot;The vital things that affect [the Negro] race and others, where changes have to be made in the attitudes of mankind, cannot, in my opinion, be done by law. I like to feel that while we have to change the hearts of men, we cannot do it by cold lawmaking, but must make these changes by appealing to reason, by prayer, and by constantly working at it through ourown efforts.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES10. Tindall on Eisenhower's view of government's proper role, previous edition</h4>
<p>Eisenhower entered office committed to civil rights in principle, and he pushed the issue in areas of federal authority. During his first three years, public services in Washington, D.C., were desegregated... Beyond that, however, two aspects of the president's philosophy inhibited vigorous action in enforcing the principle of civil rights: his preference for state or local action over federal involvement, and his doubt that laws could change racial attitudes. &quot;I don't believe you can change the hearts of men with laws or decisions,&quot; he said.</p>
<h4>ES11. Tindall on Eisenhower's greatest mistake, previous edition</h4>
<p>In the greatest mistake of his presidency, Eisenhower refused to endorse or enforce the Court's ruling.</p>
<h4>ES12. John F. Kennedy, Speech on Radio and Television, June 11, 1963</h4>
<p>&quot;We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution.The heart of the question is whether all Americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated. If an American, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public, if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote for the public officials who represent him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place? Who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay?...The fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city, North and South, where legal remedies are not at hand. Redress is sought in the streets, in demonstrations, in parades and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and threaten lives...I am, therefore, asking the Congress to enact legislation giving all Americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public—hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments...&quot;</p>
<h4>ES13. Robert Dallek on Kennedy's political calculation</h4>
<p>But once elected, Kennedy was reluctant to give in to demands for prompt and forceful action on civil rights. And his attention was elsewhere: he devoted his Inaugural Address almost exclusively to foreign affairs. Part of his restraint was simple political calculation.</p>
<h4>ES14.Tindall on Kennedy's leadership on civil rights, p. 1081 and previous edition</h4>
<p>Like Franklin Roosevelt, President Kennedy celebrated racial equality but did little to promote it until forced to do so. His caution reflected his narrow election margin in 1960. He was reluctant to challenge conservative Southern Democrats on the explosive issue of segregation.</p>
<p>Despite a few dramatic gestures of support for African-American leaders, President Kennedy only belatedly grasped the moral and emotional significance of what would become the most widespread reform movement of the decade.</p>
<h4>ES15. Robert Dallekon Kennedy's leadership on civil rights</h4>
<p>But a crisis in Birmingham, Alabama, changed his mind about the imperative of civil rights, and thus was born Kennedy's real legacy on this front.</p>
<p>A heartfelt appeal on behalf of a moral cause now trumped any self-serving political calculations.He had finally done the right thing.</p>
<p>Although J.F.K had been slow to rise to the challenge, he did ultimately meet it.</p>
<h4>ES16. William H. Chafe, The Unfinished Journey: American Since World War II(Oxford University Press, 1995). William H. Chafe is professor of history at Duke University and the author of Civilities and Civil Rights: Greensboro, North Carolina, and the Black Struggle for Freedom.</h4>
<p>&quot;For a man who had always avoided conflict on domestic issues, it was a decisive moment. Kennedy had taken sides—first, because it was right and, second because he no longer had the option of avoiding a choice.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES17. Richard Reeves, President Kennedy: Profile in Power(Simon and Schuster, 1993).</h4>
<p>Reeves isthe author of many books and teaches political science at UCLA.&quot;That was it. Legislation would follow, but, at last, the President of the United States had chosen sides.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES18. Thomas C. Reeves, A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy (The Free Press, 1991). Thomas C. Reeves is professor of history at the University of Wisconsin.</h4>
<p>&quot;Above all, [the Kennedys] wanted to quell the turmoil that threatened to disrupt the entire nation and thus destroy their administration. As always, theKennedys were thinking primarily about politics and their own political futures...The real Kennedy—as opposed to the celebrated hero espoused by the Kennedy family, the media, and the Camelot School—lacked greatness in large part because he lacked the qualities inherent in good character.&quot;</p>
<h4>ES19. Tindall on Lyndon Johnson's commitment to civil rights, p. 1099</h4>
<p>Those who dismissed Johnson as a traditional southern conservative failed to appreciate his genuine concern for the poor and his embrace of civil rights. &quot;I'm going to be the best friend the Negro ever had,&quot; Johnson bragged to a member of the White House staff.</p>
