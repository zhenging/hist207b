<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>What systems of law has the South employed to maintain the racial hierarchy?</p>
<p>In the 1950s and 1960s unprecedented efforts were mounted to revolutionize the nation's system of race relations and secure unabridged civil and political rights for African-Americansand other minorities.</p>
<p>Historians call this battle the &quot;Second Reconstruction.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>One of our objectivesis to critically examine the leadership (or lack thereof) on civil rights by presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson.</p>
<p>Pay particular attention to the passages in your text where Tindall assesses presidential leadership on civil rights.</p>
<p>Eisenhower: pp. 1052 –1053</p>
<p>Kennedy:  pp. 1081</p>
<p>Johnson:  pp. 1099 -1100</p>
