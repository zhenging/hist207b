<h4>What were the results of the Civil War?</h4>

<ul>
<li>Secession by Law (11 states left)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Waging war of the 11 states<br />
War's Result: Total Defeat of the South<br />
Lesson: If the state tries to leave, it will be destoried.</p>

<h5>2. Slavery wad dead.</h5>
<p>Ending slavery is not the original war objective.</p>
<ol>
<li>Millitary Necessity</li>
<li>Foreign Policy Necessity</li>
<li>Right Thing To Do</li>
</ol>
<p>When did Linconln end slavery?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Emancipation Proclamation</strong> - was an executive order issued by Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>3. 750,000 soldiers were dead.</h5>
<ul>
<li>Evidence Sheet 1 - This Repulic of Suffering</li>
<li>Total Population (North and South): 31 millions. (1/40 dead)</li>
<li>Casuality Ration: 70x of Vietnam War</li>
</ul>
<p>Was it worth it?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today's equivalent = 6 millons</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>The word &quot;reconstruction&quot; refers to</h4>
<ul>
<li>The period <strong>1865-1877</strong></li>
<li>The key issue of the period: readmitting the southern states into the Union</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Jefferson_Davis_Farewell.htm">Jefferson Davis' Farewell</a> - Senator Jefferson Davis (Mississippi), Address to the Senate, Jan. 21, 1861</p>
<ul>
<li>By April 1861, 11 states seceded.</li>
<li>Empty seats in Senate: 22-1 = 21.</li>
<li>Who stayed? Andrew J (1865-1869). He is loyal to Union. (P. 586)</li>
</ul>
<p>How will we know when the South are readmitted?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empty seats are filled.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Key political questions the nation faced during reconstruction</h4>
<ul>
<li>What changes would the North impose on the South as a condition of readmission to the Union?</li>
<li>How would the status and rights of the former confederate be balanced against the status and rights of the former slaves?</li>
<li>What did the freed slaves seek beyond freedom?</li>
</ul>
<h4>The national's dilemma during reconstruction</h4>
<ul>
<li>Promote the reconciliation of the North and South<br />
Andrew J<br />
Race Hatred<br />
<strong>Or</strong></li>
<li>Provide the freed slaves &quot;more (vote, legal equality, land)&quot; than just free dom<br />
Thaddeus Stevens, Radical Repulican</li>
</ul>
<h4>Sidebar</h4>
<p>Do the southern states want their seats in congress back?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seats = Power.<br />
Reunion means filling empty seats</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>1. J's Progam (J's terms of reunion)</h4>
<p><strong>A</strong>. J granted generous amnesty, pardons and restituion of property to the former confederate leaders. <em>Why was this significant?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>15,000 requested, 13,500 granted. (90%).</li>
<li>Give back political (vote, hold office) &amp; economic (land) power back to  confederate leaders (Why need pardons? Traitors)</li>
<li>Freed slaves' view of J's program?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong>. J opposed granting the right to the African-Americans. <em>Why was this significant?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>No blacks vote under J's program.</li>
<li>Lots of elections were coming up in the South.</li>
<li>Political power up for grabs</li>
<li>Black excluded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>C</strong>. J states that the southern states would have to do the following to be readmitted: ratify the 13th Amendment (No More Slavery), nullify secession, and cancel their confederate debt. <em>Why was this significant?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Mississippi and Texas defied J's program on 13th Amendment. J still supported their readmission anyway.</li>
<li>Characterize J's Program: <strong>Amazingly Lenient</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Why did J choose to promote the reconciliation of the North and South at the expense of doing &quot;more&quot; for the freed slaves?</h4>
<p><strong>A</strong>. J was commited to the doctrine of states' rights<br />
Study carefully #2 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet. (States' Rights)<br />
Be able to define and give an example of states' rights. Know why the doctrine of states' rights was significant in the debate between J and the Republicans in Congress.<br />
Know the argumetns J employed in defending states' rights and how the RRs attempted to counter those Arguments.</p>
<ul>
<li>Key state right issue: Would freed slaves vote?</li>
<li>RRs: Yes. Called On J to force black voting in the South.</li>
<li>J: It's each state's right to decide. President can't interfere</li>
<li>RRs: Teh South gave up their states' rights.</li>
<li>J: They never left and still have their rights. There is no such thing as Reconstruction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong>. J's views on Race<br />
Study carefully #3 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet. Be able to characterize J's views on Race and explain how his views on race shaped his program of reconstruction.<br />
Study carefully #4 on the Reconstruction Evidence Sheet. Know what Bowen says about J's views on race.</p>
<ul>
<li>splcenter.org</li>
<li>Racists (J commited to white surpremacy)</li>
<li>Group People</li>
<li>Brand blacks as inferior</li>
<li>J's brand of racisim: All blakcks are inferior, innate, inborn, permanent.</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Failure of J's Program</h4>
<ul>
<li>During last half of 1865</li>
<li>Under J's terms of reunion: south elected and sent new members to congress to fill empty seats.</li>
<li>White southerns' view of J's terms? &quot;Amazingly lenient&quot;. It was too good to be true. South rushed to seal with J and get their seats back.</li>
<li><em>What happend?</em> J called on congress to seat new south members.</li>
<li><em>What happend next?</em> Turning point in story.<br />
Evidence Sheet #5: Tindal P.588</li>
<li><em>Why outrage?</em> Text Study Guide -&gt; Who did south elect? -&gt; Alexander H. Stephens (VP of Confederate)</li>
<li>Final Point: J came so close to tilling seats.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>J failed Reconstruction.</strong></p>
<h4>4. Evaluating J's leadership</h4>
<ul>
<li>J had historical opportunity to advance racial justice.</li>
<li>Kept nation on course of race hatred. (No significant until 1950's, about 100 years)</li>
<li>J's legacy: A century of crushing racial opppression and terrorism.</li>
<li>Really awful president. (Ranking of J's presidency: 42/43)</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Radical Republicans (RRs)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Subset of republican party</li>
<li>They believe in equality of the races</li>
<li>Do more for freed slaves</li>
</ul>
<h5>RRs' motives? SQ #5. (P 583, 587, 588)</h5>
<p><em>Who are they?</em> Charles Sumner(Senator of Massachusetts),Benjamin Wade(Senator of Ohio); Thaddeus Stevens (House Representative of Pennsylvania)<br />
(1) Political motive: Blacks will vote republican (they are trying to help slaves).<br />
(2) Humanitarian motive: Evidence? - Part of anti-slavery movement <strong>Before</strong> civil war</p>
<ul>
<li>Stevens: In his will, he requested to be buried in integrated cemetry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Role of Religion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stevens is from Pennsylvania(Quaker state).</li>
<li>Quakers believe people are equal in God's eyes.</li>
<li>Sumner is from Massachusetts (Puritan state).</li>
<li>Puntans believe people are equal in God's eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>(3) Punishiment movtive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stevens said: The whole fabric of southern society must be changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence Sheet #6: Good example to put in essay.</p>

<li>Congress' response to veto? Override veto: need 2/3 in house + 2/3 in the Senate.</li>
<li>Did republicans have that many votes? Yes
<ul>
